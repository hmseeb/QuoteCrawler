"Valentine's Day is one of those tricky celebrations where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

And if you're opposed to it, you're considered lonely and single and have clearly never had a valentine.",Dan Levy,Valentine's Day
"One of the major dangers of being alone in February is the tendency to dwell on past relationships.
