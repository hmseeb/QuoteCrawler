"It wasn't until sixth grade, at P.S. 168, when my teacher took us on a field trip to her house that I realized we were poor.

"Doo-wop is the true music to me, man. Doo-wop was what nurtured me and grew me into who I am, and I guess even when I was in school, the teacher probably thought I had ADD or something every day, because I'd be beating on the desks, singing like the Flamingos or the Spaniels or Clyde McPhatter or somebody.",Aaron Neville,Teacher
"Success is a lousy teacher, but failure is a friend, philosopher, and guide.",Ayushmann Khurrana,Teacher

"I've always remembered something Sanford Meisner, my acting teacher, told us. When you create a character, it's like making a chair, except instead of making someting out of wood, you make it out of yourself. That's the actor's craft - using yourself to create a character.",Robert Duvall,Teacher
"I thought, well of course, Kinsey absolutely adored teaching. He was a wonderful teacher. So these kids really inspired me. So that was a clue I hung onto. He loved young people, he absolutely loved them. And he loved teaching them and trying to help them.",Liam Neeson,Teacher
"You know, if you're a human and living on the planet, it doesn't matter what you do; you are not immune to the challenges, the trials, the difficulty. And that fact that I happen to be a coach and a minister and a spiritual teacher doesn't mean anything. I'm still human.",Iyanla Vanzant,Teacher

"I liked school, but I used to dread those moments when the teacher would call me up to give an oral report.

That's how I am.",Steven Wright,Teacher
"People can look to me as a teacher, but I consider myself a student of hip-hop.",Doug E. Fresh,Teacher

"There is no recipe to be a great teacher, that's what is unique about them.",Robert Sternberg,Teacher

"I had always been fascinated with Napoleon because he was a self-made emperor; Victor Hugo said, 'Napoleon's will to power,' and it was the title of my paper. And I submitted it to my teacher, and he didn't think I had written it. And he wanted me to explain it to him.",August Wilson,Teacher
"In high school, I had a wonderful teacher who, coincidentally also taught Meryl Streep before me. At the same time I had my own rock band, I played bass and sang. I was one of those kids who really enjoyed being with my friends and doing rather insane, but fun, creative things.",Roger Bart,Teacher
"As a former high school teacher and a student in a class of 60 urchins at St. Brigid's grammar school, I know that education is all about discipline and motivation. Disadvantaged students need extra attention, a stable school environment, and enough teacher creativity to stimulate their imaginations. Those things are not expensive.",Bill O'Reilly,Teacher
"Every day, I would show up, and there were no kids, just me and my teacher in my classroom. Every day, I would be escorted by marshals past a mob of people protesting and boycotting the school. This went on for a whole year.",Ruby Bridges,Teacher

"When people say, you know, 'Good teacher,' 'Prophet,' 'Really nice guy'... this is not how Jesus thought of Himself. So you're left with a challenge in that, which is either Jesus was who he said he was or a complete and utter nut case. You have to make a choice on that.",Bono,Teacher
"I met with my spiritual teacher and went to a therapist. I realized that if I came from a positive place, not only will everyone feel better and I will feel happier, but the company will work better.",Adam Neumann,Teacher
I got into acting because my teachers kept nudging me into it. The power a teacher has to influence someone is so great. I can't think of a profession I have more respect for.,Jon Hamm,Teacher
"There is no employing class, no working class, no farming class. You may pigeonhole a man or woman as a farmer or a worker or a professional man or an employer or even a banker. But the son of the farmer will be a doctor or a worker or even a banker, and his daughter a teacher. The son of a worker will be an employer - or maybe president.",Herbert Hoover,Teacher

"My art teacher in junior high was a very out gay man and a mentor to me. He would tell us about Greenwich Village and show us the 'Village Voice' and describe his life, but it was all sort of subversive and below the radar.",Gus Van Sant,Teacher
"As a teacher I realize that what one learns in school doesn't serve for very much at all, that the only thing one can really learn is self-understanding, and this is something that can't be taught.",Laura Esquivel,Teacher
"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that oral teachers and sign teachers found it difficult to sit down in the same room without quarreling, and there was intolerance upon both sides.

Last time I was in Jamaica I financed a teacher to teach in an orphanage.,Ziggy Marley,Teacher
"I never wore a tie voluntarily, even though I was forced to wear one for photos when I was young and for official events at school.

"When I was a teacher, I definitely noticed bullying happening, and I noticed people choosing to be quiet when they should speak up.
