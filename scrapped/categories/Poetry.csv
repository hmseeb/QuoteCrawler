"I write poetry, and I put it to a beat - I mean, that's what they call rap.",Lakeith Stanfield,Poetry
"Poetry has the ability to create entire moments with just a few choice words. The spacing and line breaks create rhythm, a helpful musicality, a natural flow. The separate stanzas aid in perpetuating a kind of incremental reading, one small chunk at a time.",Jason Reynolds,Poetry
"I have frequently noticed in myself a tendency to a diffuse style; a disposition to push my metaphors too far, employing a multitude of words to heighten the patness of the image, and so making of it a conceit rather than a metaphor, a fault copiously illustrated in the poetry of Cowley, Waller, Donne, and others of that ilk.",Sidney Lanier,Poetry
"What other people may find in poetry or art museums, I find in the flight of a good drive.",Arnold Palmer,Poetry

"I think when kids just see well-crafted poetry, it's just obtuse to them. It's hard to relate to.",Jewel,Poetry

"Poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.",T. S. Eliot,Poetry
The genesis of a poem for me is usually a cluster of words. The only good metaphor I can think of is a scientific one: dipping a thread into a supersaturated solution to induce crystal formation. I don't think I solve problems in my poetry; I think I uncover the problems.,Margaret Atwood,Poetry
The fate of poetry is to fall in love with the world.,Derek Walcott,Poetry
Poetry is what we do to break bread with the dead.,Seamus Heaney,Poetry

"As a direct line to human feeling, empathic experience, genuine language and detail, poetry is everything that headline news is not.

"I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.",Mahmoud Darwish,Poetry
"I write poetry, and I put it to a beat - I mean, that's what they call rap.",Lakeith Stanfield,Poetry
"I liked painting and drawing, and I liked humanities mainly - poetry, literature - this speculative attitude toward life.",Rafael Moneo,Poetry

"In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats - maybe it's imperative that we encounter the defeats - but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be. Human beings are more alike than unalike.",Maya Angelou,Poetry
Poetry is a sort of homecoming.,Paul Celan,Poetry

"Poetry is above all a concentration of the power of language, which is the power of our ultimate relationship to everything in the universe.",Adrienne Rich,Poetry

"Art: If the object of poetry is, to make men, then poetry is the heir of prophecy.",Muhammad Iqbal,Poetry
"When I was a little girl, I did not listen to music much. I did not think that one day I would become a rapper. I was born in a very traditional and religious family.

"Love is poetry. To fall in love with a person is like understanding a deep, moving poem. Noticing every little detail. To see what the poet shows, to smell what he describes and the urge to taste the intangible.",Shweta Basu Prasad,Poetry
"One: whose shoulders do you stand on? And two: what do you stand for?

"Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life.",Lascelles Abercrombie,Poetry

There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time. And I'd say the same thing about poetry and gardening. Gardening slows me down. I want to stop and observe everything.,Ross Gay,Poetry
I could no more define poetry than a terrier can define a rat.,A. E. Housman,Poetry
"I've often said that all poetry is political. This is because real poems deal with a human response to reality and politics is part of reality, history in the making. Even if a poet writes about sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.",Yehuda Amichai,Poetry

"Science is for those who learn, poetry is for those who know.",Joseph Roux,Poetry
"Poetry has the ability to create entire moments with just a few choice words. The spacing and line breaks create rhythm, a helpful musicality, a natural flow. The separate stanzas aid in perpetuating a kind of incremental reading, one small chunk at a time.",Jason Reynolds,Poetry
"Rhyme, that enslaved queen, that supreme charm of our poetry, that creator of our meter.",Victor Hugo,Poetry
"I have frequently noticed in myself a tendency to a diffuse style; a disposition to push my metaphors too far, employing a multitude of words to heighten the patness of the image, and so making of it a conceit rather than a metaphor, a fault copiously illustrated in the poetry of Cowley, Waller, Donne, and others of that ilk.",Sidney Lanier,Poetry
I read poetry to save time.,Marilyn Monroe,Poetry

"Probably all the attention to poetry results in some value, though the attention is more often directed to lesser than to greater values.",A. R. Ammons,Poetry
"I define poetry as celebration and confrontation. When we witness something, are we responsible for what we witness? That's an on-going existential question.

"My first spoken word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine.

"All slang is metaphor, and all metaphor is poetry.",Gilbert K. Chesterton,Poetry

"A verbal art like poetry is reflective; it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.",W. H. Auden,Poetry

"Poetry is a domestic art, most itself when most at home.",Seamus Heaney,Poetry

"I have to interweave my poetry with purpose. For me, that purpose is to help people, and to shed a light on issues that have far too long been in the darkness.",Amanda Gorman,Poetry
I did not move into developing or processing color. I stayed with black and white.

I have worked in color when I thought it was the appropriate way to express the thought that I was working on.,Leonard Nimoy,Poetry
"For me, prose walks, poetry dances.",James Broughton,Poetry
"Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.",Wislawa Szymborska,Poetry

Poetry is more a threshold than a path.,Seamus Heaney,Poetry
"It's always good when women win things in fiction because it tends to be more male-dominated, unlike poetry, which is more equal.",Carol Ann Duffy,Poetry
I have always wanted what I have now come to call the voice of personal narrative. That has always been the appealing voice in poetry. It started for me lyrically in Shakespeare's sonnets.,Diane Wakoski,Poetry

"I liked to write from the time I was about 12 or 13. I loved to read. And since I only spoke to my brother, I would write down my thoughts.

"Poetry, first and foremost, is the lyric. It's the music.",Robin Coste Lewis,Poetry

Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem.,Billy Collins,Poetry

"I learn poetry, learn text, and that really keeps you alive.",Anthony Hopkins,Poetry

"I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a vocation, a religious vocation.",Derek Walcott,Poetry

Poetry is all nouns and verbs.,Marianne Moore,Poetry
"If there's no money in poetry, neither is there poetry in money.",Robert Graves,Poetry

Poetry is the key to the hieroglyphics of nature.,David Hare,Poetry

"There's a fierce practicality and empiricism which the whole imaginative, lyrical aspect of poetry comes from.",David Whyte,Poetry

O'Rourke,Poetry
Poetry remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art.,Jorge Luis Borges,Poetry

"For a lot of people, well-meaning teaching has made poetry seem arcane, difficult, a kind of brown-knotting medicine that might be good for you but doesn't taste so good. So I tried to make a collection of poetry that would be fun. And that would bring out poetry as an art, rather than the challenge to say smart things.",Robert Pinsky,Poetry
"But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.",Lascelles Abercrombie,Poetry

"If there were no poetry on any day in the world, poetry would be invented that day. For there would be an intolerable hunger.",Muriel Rukeyser,Poetry
Auden said poetry makes nothing happen. But I wonder if the opposite could be true. It could make something happen.,Carol Ann Duffy,Poetry

"I've been writing all my life, and playing bass came later on, when I was about 26.

It was another avenue of expression that my soul needs.",Malcolm-Jamal Warner,Poetry
"Reading a piece of poetry with no beat in front of 20 people is way more challenging than rocking for 10,000 people.",Macklemore,Poetry
I think poetry can help children deal with the other subjects on the curriculum by enabling them to see a subject in a new way.,Carol Ann Duffy,Poetry

"When you realize my best selling books are 'Owl Moon,' the 'How Do Dinosaur' books, and 'Devil's Arithmetic,' how can the public make sense of that! I have fans who think I only write picture books or only write SF and fantasy. I have fanatics of my poetry and are stunned to find out I write prose, too!",Jane Yolen,Poetry
"I read a lot of poetry, and I love what it does with language. I love music, too, and I think there's probably no coincidence there, that the rhythm of the words is almost as important as the words themselves, and when you can get the two working together, which usually takes me about 20 goes, I feel a huge satisfaction.",Kate Grenville,Poetry
"I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month.

"I'm ashamed to admit that I very seldom read poetry, even though many of my friends are poets.",Celeste Ng,Poetry

"I'm about 75 pages into a book on poetry. I don't know if anybody wants to read it. It's on any broad variety of subjects.

"When you are learning through poetry how to speak English, it lends to a great understanding of sound, of pitch, of pronunciation, so I think of my speech impediment not as a weakness or a disability, but as one of my greatest strengths.",Amanda Gorman,Poetry
"I thought it would be a funny concept to publish a book about stand-up comedy with Faber, the poetry publisher, and to apply to stand-up the same sort of weight of annotation that you would to a classic work of literature, an epic poem. I thought that would be funny.",Stewart Lee,Poetry
"I think that the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time.",Robert Hass,Poetry

"What does that represent? There was never any question in plastic art, in poetry, in music, of representing anything. It is a matter of making something beautiful, moving, or dramatic - this is by no means the same thing.",Fernand Leger,Poetry
"At twenty, I implicitly dissociated poetry from politics.",Adrienne Rich,Poetry
"There isn't, even now, a great tradition of novel-writing in Afghanistan. Most of the literature is in the form of poetry.",Khaled Hosseini,Poetry

"I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it.

"All good poetry is forged slowly and patiently, link by link, with sweat and blood and tears.",Lord Alfred Douglas,Poetry

Poetry is the communication through words of certain experiences that can be communicated in no other way.,John Drinkwater,Poetry

"Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.",Diane Wakoski,Poetry

"I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.",Diane Wakoski,Poetry
Most people can't tell now who wrote what. I like that blurring of identities within the band. because it becomes a unified thing that can't be related to other forms of historical poetry.,Thurston Moore,Poetry
"All those authors there, most of whom of course I've never met. That's the poetry side, that's the prose side, that's the fishing and miscellaneous behind me. You get an affection for books that you've enjoyed.",Norman MacCaig,Poetry

"Because people are very interested in my poetry, in what I say.",Compay Segundo,Poetry
"While I've had a great distaste for what's usually called song in modern poetry or for what's usually called music, I really don't think of speech as so far from song.",David Antin,Poetry
I hardly remember how I started to write poetry. It's hard to imagine what I thought poetry could do.,David Antin,Poetry
