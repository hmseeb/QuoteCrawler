"My favorite monster has always been the zombie. They are so much fun. They can be scary, pathetic, sad, funny, tragic, even heroic. They are the most elastic monster because, even with all of that, they don't interfere with telling stories about the humans. They serve as threats and metaphors, but they allow the story to be about people.",Jonathan Maberry,Sad

"When I'm a bit sad, I often go for a drive in the country, quite fast with my music up.",Calvin Harris,Sad
"I look at television as a giant commercial for promoting this mission that I'm on. It's the best way for me to show that girls can be anything they set their minds to. I don't do it for the fame, and I most certainly don't do it for the money. It's sad that a lot of people want to get into television specifically for that reason.",Jessi Combs,Sad

"Film-makers are always going to be interested in making movies that plug into society around them. That's what a vibrant, artistically alert community should be doing. After all, it would be sad if we only made films about alien robots.",Mark Boal,Sad
"I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.",Julie Burchill,Sad

"There are a lot of people who consider themselves 'spiritual,' but that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people.

That's kind of sad.",Zachary Levi,Sad
What I find sad is that the New Age movement is primarily a commercial undertaking. But it is answering to a human need.,Laura Esquivel,Sad
"Nolan has the strangest affect on people. You know, I think there's something very sad and little boy about him, but at the same time the way he goes about everything is so awkward and obnoxious.

"It's sad when you can't make everyone happy, though. It's impossible but, at the same time, you still hope. You think, 'Maybe I can do it,' but you know you can't.

"When I look back at those pictures of my mother performing - and listen to her recordings - it makes me sad to think that all of that joy she found in her work came to an end.

"I'm part of the party, getting the crowd fired up, singing songs, pouring drinks, whatever it takes to get them to have a good time. When I walk into the meet-and-greet, someone's always going to have a story, a sad story or a happy story.",Dierks Bentley,Sad
"My experience, with both my parents, is that grief has a lot of down, sad things, but I was also really emotionally raw, in the first year after each of them passed.

I'm a sucker for sad disco pop.,Sophie Ellis-Bextor,Sad
"Music videos are notoriously long, not fun, grueling.

"With Facebook, you're not really allowed to be unhappy. Think about it: There's only a like button. Yes, you can be angry, but it's only lighthearted rage. On Reddit, perhaps because you can be anonymous, people are willing to be openly sad or angry. They are more honest.",Yishan Wong,Sad
"If people who cherish freedom, who know the importance of mutual respect and are aware of the imperative necessity to establish a constructive and critical debate, if these people are not ready to speak out, to be more committed and visible, then we can expect sad, painful tomorrows.

"I get kind of sad when I look at all of my magazines and think about how at one time I was much more impressed with a certain fashion editorial, or how I feel like I can't really relate to being that excited about fashion anymore.

I like to be sad once in a while. You need it for your equilibrium.,Marjane Satrapi,Sad
"Scientists habitually moan that the public doesn't understand them. But they complain too much: public ignorance isn't peculiar to science.

But it's equally sad if they're ignorant of their nation's history, can't speak a second language, or can't find Venezuela or Syria on a map.",Martin Rees,Sad
Guys should not be allowed to use the Internet all day long. So sad.,Natasha Leggero,Sad
"I took a couple of classes in clowning, but that was more like Lucille Ball kind of slapstick, not Ringling Brothers.

It's important to get well-rounded right off the bat. A lot of experienced dancers can get pigeonholed into one thing.
