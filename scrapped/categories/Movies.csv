"That was the moment I wanted to use bitcoin: when I saw Harriet Tubman on a $20 bill. It's like, when you see all the slave movies, it's like, why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don't you put Michael Jordan on a $20 bill?",Candace Owens,Movies
"It's simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they're done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it's what they see. That's where my head is at.",Denzel Washington,Movies

"When I got depressed, I watched Bruce Lee movies. I learned everything from Bruce Lee.",Jackie Chan,Movies

"One of the skills I had to learn and become proficient in is kissing a man. I had never kissed a man. Will Smith did it in his movies, so did Jake Gyllenhaal, and I figured it was my time. So it was me and Steve Carell - fantastic.",Dwayne Johnson,Movies
"I did a few movies, but the word 'star'... I cannot compare to a star like Clint Eastwood.

"Some people ask why people would go into a dark room to be scared. I say they are already scared, and they need to have that fear manipulated and massaged. I think of horror movies as the disturbed dreams of a society.",Wes Craven,Movies
"I think that, in the beginning, you think, 'I want to be the biggest movie star in the world.' And then, with the more movies you make, you are like, 'I don't know if I want to be that anymore.

"My parents never told me I couldn't do anything, I remember watching superhero movies and saying, 'I wish I had superpowers.' And my dad said, 'You do. You just have to find them.'",Caleb McLaughlin,Movies

I love all of the Marvel comics movies.,Lewis Hamilton,Movies
"I like happy endings in movies. I think life has a happy ending. When it's all said and done, it's all something worthwhile, and I want my movies to reflect that. There are enough things to be sad about. When you pop in a movie, let the message be one that's one of hope.",Jon Favreau,Movies
"I had been around Bruce Willis for two straight movies, so I saw the way the paparazzi follows him and the way the public is with him. He's a mega-star over in Europe.",Cole Hauser,Movies

"I just don't feel like I've seen very many movies about 17-year-old girls where the question is not, 'Will she find the right guy' or 'Will he find her?' The question should be, 'Is she going to occupy her personhood?' Because I think we're very unused to seeing female characters, particularly young female characters, as people.",Greta Gerwig,Movies

"Life is short. I'm 47 years old. I've got 10 years to go where I can be the best I can be. I want those 10 years to be precious, not like before, cranking two or three movies a year. I've made a ton of movies in my life, but so what?",Jean-Claude Van Damme,Movies

"Movies are boring. It's like watching paint dry. I did a little role in a movie, and it was eight lines. I was there for three days. It's just horrible. Television is 15 hour days. Movies are 18 hour days. And it's 18 hours of doing not a thing.",Ron White,Movies

"What's interesting about the shift from an industrial age to a technological age is that we keep inventing new media: movies, records, radio, television, the Internet, and now ebooks - and one of the things that's most interesting about the invention of a new medium is watching it reinvent itself as it penetrates the culture.",David Gerrold,Movies

"The way I look at it, you've got to quit your TV series before they'll consider you in movies.",Bob Crane,Movies
"In 'Expendables 2,' there was a lot of vulgar dialogue in the screenplay. For this reason, many young people wouldn't be able to watch this. But I don't play in movies like this. Due to that, I said, 'I won't be a part of that if the hardcore language is not erased.'",Chuck Norris,Movies
"Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and I were so different from each other. I was doing very young movies, and Marilyn, who was ahead of me, was doing a lot of homogenized movies that weren't quite as wild as the ones I was doing. Jayne was more of a character of herself.",Mamie Van Doren,Movies
"Some movies bring out the creativity in you. Every single audience member can become creative in the face of a particular movie. If you happen to like my films, it's because my films provide a bed for you on which you can find your creativity. The Hollywood movies do not provide that for you.",Abbas Kiarostami,Movies
I made some truly awful movies. 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' was the worst. If you ever want someone to confess to murder just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.,Sylvester Stallone,Movies
I don't like baseball movies. I like movies about moral courage and people who are indomitable and courageous and right.,Harrison Ford,Movies
When I saw 'Bully' and I was 11 or 12 years old I thought I could do this; I could make movies. Larry Clark's cinematography is very raw. It's also based on a true story. I think a lot of the movies I like are based on true stories.,Julia Fox,Movies
"If I would rescue one of my movies, it would be 'A Little Princess.'",Alfonso Cuaron,Movies

"The greats are 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Exorcist' - those movies were not really slashers: they were about psychological terror and had very deep emotional backdrops. If we do our best, '6 Miranda Drive' can be that kind of a movie.",Kevin Bacon,Movies

"It's actually kind of cool that women have taken to me. Because now I have a whole different demographic when it comes to the audiences.

"No, 'F/X 2' was a job. I enjoyed doing it but that was definitely a job. I wrote that, I didn't direct it but 'Candyman' and the earlier horror movies I made, I was completely into horror and suspense and always have been. It's informed everything I've done, even the way scenes are shot in 'Kinsey and 'Gods and Monsters.'",Bill Condon,Movies

Timing is a very important part of being a father. You should never show your kids things before they're ready. Especially with movies.

I was very influenced by movies; I was very influenced by a world that had a sense of dream.,Ralph Lauren,Movies
I'm obsessed with the power of music and image together. There's also something about music videos that are incredibly glamorous - there's a fetishistic aesthetic to them that you don't really see in movies in the same way.,Max Minghella,Movies

"'Cloverfield' and 'REC' are great examples of movies that took kind of tired genres, the monster movie and the zombie film, and by filming them in found footage, it was a new perspective. It gives you a whole new take and helps you re-experience that all over again.",Adam Wingard,Movies
"I've been blessed to have acting opportunities in movies, television, as well as Broadway, and definitely want to continue to do so.",Nick Jonas,Movies
"With 'Brick' there was the Dashiell Hammett influence, and with 'Brothers Bloom' there was a really strong Fellini influence - both those movies wore that on their sleeve.",Rian Johnson,Movies

I think the audience would like to see movies that are stunning to watch. I really think they'd like to see spectacles.,Jan de Bont,Movies
"Whereas 'Avatar' and other movies get shocks out of their three-dimensionality, 'Gatsby' is going to be about inviting the audience into this larger-than-life drama, letting them almost be inside the room rather than looking at it through the window. I think it will really work.",Joel Edgerton,Movies

"I don't want to make movies for kids, and I don't want to make movies for adults either.",Kristen Stewart,Movies
"'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' is one of my favorite movies; it's a film that's a human comedy, it's a drama, and the characters all, in a way, fit the teenage archetypes, but they don't become stereotypes because each of the actors brought their own presence and their own personality to the screen.",Josh Trank,Movies

"I once went on a date where the girl drove and so couldn't drink. I was nervous, so drank quite a bit - it didn't end amazingly. As much as I love movies, I think cinema dates can be weird because you essentially sit next to each other in silence for a couple of hours.",Dan Smith,Movies
"I always loved all kinds of music. I would watch musicals a lot as a kid, on TV, watch the Fred Astaire movies. I'd watch 'The Wizard of Oz.'

I was always enamored of that style of music.",Queen Latifah,Movies

"I traveled to Morocco once, and I only saw one television when I was there, but I did go into this dirt cave and I saw this kid chopping tomatoes and pita, and he had a picture on the wall of Jean-Claude Van Damme holding a gun. That connected with him on the other side of the world, so no wonder these big movies are made - they have a mass appeal.",Parker Posey,Movies
"All my movies have an autobiographical dimension, but that is indirectly, through the personages. In fact, I am behind everything that happens and that is said, but I am never talking about myself in first person singular.",Pedro Almodovar,Movies

"One of my gripes about movies is that people take them so seriously, and the moneymaking aspects are so brutal.",Bill Murray,Movies

"Whereas 'Avatar' and other movies get shocks out of their three-dimensionality, 'Gatsby' is going to be about inviting the audience into this larger-than-life drama, letting them almost be inside the room rather than looking at it through the window. I think it will really work.",Joel Edgerton,Movies
"I just grew up watching a lot of movies. I'm attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story. As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that isn't quite what I'm seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I've never seen before.",Quentin Tarantino,Movies
"I had an interest in film, but I didn't want to go to Hollywood and make movies.",Adam Page,Movies
"I like to work with directors where you feel they make the movies not for the audience, but make them for themselves. They don't care if it's a success financially. That's what I like.",Udo Kier,Movies
"Acting just didn't seem like a viable option. I didn't have any connections in the industry, and I had little support from my family. Also, there just weren't a lot of Asian-Americans on TV or in the movies.",Randall Park,Movies
"I didn't get my hair cut for two movies, and it got a little long. I'm going back to a... not a crew cut. Back to, oh, about a Presbyterian length.",Lee Marvin,Movies

"The thing about movies is that till it goes on floors, it's just preparations for the film.",Mohanlal,Movies

There's not a lot of good movies being made.,Sean Penn,Movies
"I feel that, historically, the Art Deco period has the most resonance for me. As a person, it has to be the plucky Clara Bow, the heroine of American silent movies of the 1920s. She embodied feminine dressing mixed with men's style. All this then evolved into the exquisite style and simplicity of Coco Chanel.",Anouska Hempel,Movies
"I got really into Martin Scorsese as a teenager, so then it was kind of the whole reason I wanted to be an actor. Just like tons of young actors, I think, get freaked out by the Scorsese/DeNiro movies. I loved all his movies in the '90s, too. Then I got a part in 'The Aviator' and couldn't believe it.",Adam Scott,Movies

"I play a little guitar, write a few tunes, make a few movies, but none of that's really me. The real me is something else.",George Harrison,Movies
"'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' is one of my favorite movies; it's a film that's a human comedy, it's a drama, and the characters all, in a way, fit the teenage archetypes, but they don't become stereotypes because each of the actors brought their own presence and their own personality to the screen.",Josh Trank,Movies
"I did a lot of hokey movies when I was starting out at MGM. Good and bad, mostly bad.",Ava Gardner,Movies

Why should you have to atone for making big movies?,Emily Blunt,Movies
'License to Kill' is not one of the great Bond movies.,Benicio Del Toro,Movies

"'Girl, Interrupted' is one of my favorite movies.",Halston Sage,Movies
I remember watching Quentin Tarantino accept an Academy Award for screenwriting for 'Pulp Fiction.' If I'd known then that 15 years later one of his movies would again be nominated for an Oscar and I'd be in it - that would be pretty crazy.,Paul Rust,Movies
Success begets success. I've been offered a lot of movies now that '30 Rock' has been successful.,Alec Baldwin,Movies

I do like escapism. I like going to the movies on a Friday night and seeing something fun.,Charlie Kaufman,Movies
"I just went to your typical public schools, and my dad would take us to the movies every week, or he'd buy scalped tickets to San Antonio Spurs games. I remember I was four or five years old and my parents, who were very young, took us to see The Police in Austin, and Iggy Pop opened.",Pedro Pascal,Movies
"He's my favorite! He wrote and produced, and starred in and cast all of his movies! Can you imagine? I get really excited when I talk about Charlie Chaplin.",Emma Stone,Movies
'Jolly LLB' is one of my favorite movies. Courtroom films are rare to come by in Telugu.,Nani,Movies
"That's the way this business works: if your movies do well at the box office, you will be offered more movies. It doesn't matter if you're a nice guy or you're a prick. If your movies do well, there's a job waiting for you in Hollywood. It's not any more complicated than that.",Matt Damon,Movies
"There's this little box that African-American actors have to work in, in the first place, and I was able to rise above that box. I could have done a bunch of movies where I stayed as the Axel Foley or Reggie Hammond persona. But I didn't want to be doing the same thing all the time. Every now and then, you crash and burn, but that's part of it.",Eddie Murphy,Movies
"I was the guy who had been bouncing around the film industry for years, and I'd been lucky if five or 10 people would see my movies, so Captain Jack did a big flip for my career.",Johnny Depp,Movies
"I'll watch movies I like to see, Steve Jobs interviews, something that's going to make me smart and then go to sleep.",Jaden Smith,Movies

I like four-hour movies.,Kevin Costner,Movies
"I often begin movies with music in my head; it's a very important dimension to me. Not just the music itself, but how to use music in film: when and how and subtlety. I don't like to be too sweet in my stories, and I like the abrasive clang, the contrasting of sounds and cultures.",Mira Nair,Movies
I got my MFA from AFI as a director in 2010. I've had time to make the shorts that I made previous to 'Hereditary' and to kind of build these movies in my head.,Ari Aster,Movies
"The guys that do have the confidence to hit on me are not necessarily my type, but they think they are because I'm a pop star; I sing songs, do movies. I like to feel sexy and confident on stage.",Selena Gomez,Movies
I love doing action and stuff; the problem is usually action movies are not that interesting. Also as I get older I feel like there's less opportunities for me.,Willem Dafoe,Movies
"I think action movies bring more excitement than tears, but I always want to take it to another level. I mean, I think if one appreciates anything in life to a certain degree, it could possibly bring tears to your eyes.",Donnie Yen,Movies
"'Oppam' is more of a director's movie, especially because I play a visually-challenged hero in it. The character doesn't have a perspective, and so cameras aren't placed like how they are usually done in other movies. The angles and the way the scenes are captured are different.",Mohanlal,Movies

"I feel the really big stars are in movies, not TV.",Bob Crane,Movies
"I just sort of feel like John Hughes movies are perfect, but they're missing violence. If they just had some violence, they'd be perfect.",Ryan Gosling,Movies
"The person that made me want to make movies, and the reason I do films, is Bruce Lee. He was an incredible actor, and he had a lot of charisma. Handsome, action, you know, everything was there. I loved Bruce Lee.",LL Cool J,Movies
"I've often been accused of, 'Oh the movies looked good but there's no story,' but I disagree with that in theory, and '9' is a perfect example for me because the feel, the texture, and the look of that world, and those characters, is the story. That's a major component of why you feel the way you do when you're watching it.",Tim Burton,Movies
All my movies are achingly personal.,Quentin Tarantino,Movies
"I get a lot from all young people. I make movies for young people. If I made pictures for people my age, no one would see them. I hang with young people all the time.",Robert Evans,Movies
"In the movies, I kill guys with an axe. In real life, I can't control a nine-year-old girl.",Sylvester Stallone,Movies
I couldn't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games' and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don't take it lightly.

There's very few dork movies made by dorks.,Zack Snyder,Movies
"Good movies are difficult to make, and good trash is even harder to make.",Udo Kier,Movies

"They make three types of movies, and if you don't make one of those three, you have to find independent financing: It's either big-action superhero tent-pole thing, or it's an animated film, or it's an R-rated, raunchy sex comedy. They don't make movies about real people.",Rob Reiner,Movies
"All through my life what I've loved doing is watching movies. I love the escapism of film, I love stories. So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am, to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product.",Keira Knightley,Movies
"Through most of my career, I've made a decent living making movies no one wants to see.",Jean-Luc Godard,Movies
"When my mother got home from work, she would take me to the movies. It was her way of getting out, and she would take me with her. I'd go home and act all the parts. It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor.",Al Pacino,Movies
"Most of the time it's the role. Sometimes it's the story and sometimes it just the paycheck. It's the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that I have work to go out, you know what I'm saying, you can only be out so long without work, you start getting antsy.",Morgan Freeman,Movies
"There should be a point to movies. Sure, you're giving people a diversion from the cold world for a bit, but at the same time, you pass on some facts and rules and maybe a little bit of wisdom.",George Lucas,Movies
"I've been lucky, I've had movies that made a lot of money, so I don't feel like I have to kill every time out. I don't want that pressure. I don't need it.",Bill Murray,Movies
"I don't know if I see myself as really an action hero, but I like doing physical movies and I like doing movies where the writing is very lean.",Jodie Foster,Movies
I just make good movies. That's the way I thank my fans.,Jackie Chan,Movies
"I was lucky that one of my first movies, 'One Million Years B.C.' was made in Europe by a British company. The Brits, and a lot of the rest of Europe, seemed to really love exotic women. The fact that I was American and exotic just made me more appealing to them.",Raquel Welch,Movies
"Music is the only passion I shamelessly indulge in. However, for recreation I enjoy watching movies. 'Wizard of Oz' was the first film I ever saw, followed by the 'Bond' movies. I also watch a lot of World cinema through DVDs mostly brought by one of my best friends who's now based in Toronto.",A. R. Rahman,Movies
"A man becomes what he dreams. And I dreamed of being in the movies. I was brought up on Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty, and Cary Grant.",Pierce Brosnan,Movies
I don't like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.,Robert De Niro,Movies

"I love dancing just because I've done it my whole life and it's definitely what I want to do. I feel like, I want to train with acting and do movies. Those two are my main priorities. I definitely want to be able to sing and model, too. I definitely love those, too.",Maddie Ziegler,Movies
"If I do three movies in a year, I don't feel like acting ever again.",Ethan Hawke,Movies
"No, 'F/X 2' was a job. I enjoyed doing it but that was definitely a job. I wrote that, I didn't direct it but 'Candyman' and the earlier horror movies I made, I was completely into horror and suspense and always have been. It's informed everything I've done, even the way scenes are shot in 'Kinsey and 'Gods and Monsters.'",Bill Condon,Movies
"I read, I watch a lot of movies, I'm constantly living, so I'm constantly having more to say.",Damian Lillard,Movies
"I wasn't allowed to go to movies when I was kid; my father was a minister. 101 Dalmatians and King of Kings, that was the extent of it.",Denzel Washington,Movies
My motto: 'No good movie is depressing. All bad movies are depressing.',Roger Ebert,Movies
I have a shot a lot of movies in Dubai.,Mohanlal,Movies
"I like a movie that brings out many discussions. From my experience, every time I have done movies, they create this kind of situation. Like 'Irreversible,' 'The Passion of the Christ,' 'Malena'; it's so interesting. I like to explore the dark side of humanity. That's why I'm an actor.",Monica Bellucci,Movies
"I think audiences have always wanted to see women in the movies, but every time a movie like 'Bridesmaids' comes out, everyone says, 'Oh how funny, people do want to see women in the movies.'",Isla Fisher,Movies
People love teen movies because everyone can relate.,Zoe Kravitz,Movies
I do really like serio-comic movies that treat real difficulties in a real way.,Ron Howard,Movies
"I've always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I'd put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.",Emma Roberts,Movies
"The movies saved my life. I grew up in the great depression, the only child of a pair of star crossed lovers. My father lost his job. My mother drank. They fought. The movies were my escape.",Orson Bean,Movies
"Movies are a director's medium, and they end up getting less credit than actors. They get the flak if the movie doesn't do well, and the actor walks away with most of the credit if the film does well.",Ranbir Kapoor,Movies
"For me, it's about becoming a mogul, owning my own projects, and establishing myself as a funding producer. That's what's big to me. The movies and all that stuff are great, but the fact that I'm in a position to do what I want to do, however I want to do it and when I want to do it is bigger.",Kevin Hart,Movies
"Movies were invented for Jimmy Cagney, and he was invented for the movies. A perfect match.",Clint Eastwood,Movies

Being alone is scarier than any boogey man and the reason why I don't choose to see Horror movies as a rule.,Tom Sizemore,Movies

My mom took me to see Carnal Knowledge and The Wild Bunch and all these kind of movies when I was a kid.,Quentin Tarantino,Movies
"I once went on a date where the girl drove and so couldn't drink. I was nervous, so drank quite a bit - it didn't end amazingly. As much as I love movies, I think cinema dates can be weird because you essentially sit next to each other in silence for a couple of hours.",Dan Smith,Movies
"In Hollywood, they think drawn animation doesn't work anymore, computers are the way. They forget that the reason computers are the way is that Pixar makes good movies. So everybody tries to copy Pixar. They're relying too much on the technology and not enough on the artists.",Tim Burton,Movies
"It's logical when you become known to the industry with 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' that they typecast you and want you in their horror movies. That's how I got 'Blade,' of course, because they were fans.",Udo Kier,Movies
"I never wanted to do the same kind of movies over and over anyway, so my theory on it all is I'm just gonna try and dodge the label and keep doing what I am doing.",Matt Damon,Movies
"'Dirty Dancing' is one of my favorite movies, and I was in love with Patrick Swayze for years, but I tried to stay out of his way and never to meet him because I knew if I did, he'd want to talk about yogurt or some weird dietary restriction or something.",Eve Babitz,Movies

Movies were my first love.,Anya Taylor-Joy,Movies

I've always really loved cinematography and glamorous old Hollywood movies and they go hand in hand.,Violet Chachki,Movies
"My movies were the kind they show in prisons and airplanes, because nobody can leave.",Burt Reynolds,Movies

"It's not like I'm the first man ever to do this, y'know? You gotta go back to Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and Sammy Davis Jr. Those are people who've done music well and movies well, and y'know, Frank Sinatra and Elvis and all these dudes have made the transition. I don't know about Elvis, 'bout doin' 'em good, y'know? It's nothin' new.",Ice Cube,Movies
Bond is the longest-running franchise ever and there's a reason for that: they are action movies but they are also touched by current events without being political or too serious.,Javier Bardem,Movies
"I hate Bollywood. The movies are all garbage, just terrible. It's my opinion; obviously, there are billions who like and love them. I don't like all the singing, dancing and all the dramatic crying. I have never seen a Bollywood film in my life.",Russell Peters,Movies
A lot of times you get credit for stuff in your movies you didn't intend to be there.,Spike Lee,Movies
I remember being a kid and sleeping over at my friend's house and staying up late and watching 'Nosferatu.' Vampire movies are supposed to be secret and bad. They should be rated R.,Ethan Hawke,Movies

"Commercials led to TV, and TV led to movies here and there.",John Ross Bowie,Movies

"In our culture, we get very much into shorthanding people. And I got shorthanded as That Guy: Jennifer Lopez, movies bombed, therefore he must be a sort of thoughtless dilettante, solipsistic consumer blahblahblah. It's hard to shake those sort of narratives.",Ben Affleck,Movies
"I always shoot my movies with score as certainly part of the dialogue. Music is dialogue. People don't think about it that way, but music is actually dialogue. And sometimes music is the final, finished, additional dialogue. Music can be one of the final characters in the film.",Ridley Scott,Movies
The day I can't walk is the day I quit movies.,Sylvester Stallone,Movies
Movies don't make people act a fool. People act a fool because they want to act a fool.,Eazy-E,Movies
"I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines.

The kinds of movies I make are not easy to get made.,Peter Hedges,Movies
"We're more familiar with what economists call an English auction - prices start low and rise as people bid. However, there is also the Dutch auction, where prices start high and go lower until somebody bites. Movies are sold to the audience via a very slow Dutch auction, where each phase between price drops can last weeks or months.",Nathan Myhrvold,Movies

"When I was young, I had a favorite movie star. One day, I saw one of his movies, and it was bad, and he was bad in it. I could tell he didn't care and only did it for the money. I felt betrayed. I never watched another one of his movies again.",Michael Jai White,Movies
"I really care about this stuff, I care about movies, and you just have to be strong and don't be stupid; freedom of choice is a big responsibility, and I'm lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent, so there's no need to be greedy.",Jonah Hill,Movies
"I took an acting class with Louise Lasser, Woody Allen's first wife and co-star in many movies. I've done some other indie films, if you look on the YouTube. I love acting - it's great.",Gary Shteyngart,Movies
If you really want to be competitive in today's market you have to be in movies that make money.,Halle Berry,Movies
"In the '50s, audiences accepted a level of artifice that the audiences in 1966 would chuckle at. And the audiences of 1978 would chuckle at what the audience of 1966 said was okay, too. The trick is to try to be way ahead of that curve, so they're not chuckling at your movies 20 years down the line.",Quentin Tarantino,Movies
"'Deadpool' is its own thing, and it's very quirky, breaks out the box, and doesn't follow the rules of normal superhero movies, so it was really important for me to show that kids that look like me, who are chubbier than other kids, that they can be the hero they want - it was a dream of mine to be a superhero, and it's come true.",Julian Dennison,Movies
The only thing that would really make my mother angry would be if I liked horror movies or violence or Ronald Reagan. And very violent films were a way for me to rebel. You have to rebel against your parents.,Nicolas Winding Refn,Movies
In all the movies I'm in love with someone in my head. There's always love in a film somewhere. It doesn't matter even if it's an action movie.,Channing Tatum,Movies
"The idea of us telling a story where a character doesn't get everything he wants at the end is one of the relatable things - dealing with failures and missteps in life - and it's something that's so rarely dealt with in movies, especially kids' movies.",Dan Scanlon,Movies
"I'd love to do something where I can act and dance at the same time, like on Broadway or in movies.",Maddie Ziegler,Movies
"'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is just one of those movies that's like a page of history. You can't really go wrong. It's a prequel. It's not like number three. Which is really cool, to be the before as opposed to the after.",Diora Baird,Movies
"I have personal beliefs and they are sometimes reflected in the movies I make, but I also reflect other points of view.",Tim Robbins,Movies
"I always like to do sound design, and in movies, you have more leeway with that, but I don't really notice that sound design is being used in TV other than just location sound.",Reed Morano,Movies
"I learned English at school, or at least that's how it started. Also, in Holland - as opposed to some other European countries - we don't dub anything, so as a kid growing up, always watching English and American movies in their original language really helped.",Michiel Huisman,Movies
"The movies I cannot go without and that I watch annually are 'A Clockwork Orange,' 'Scarface' and 'Fantasia.'",Nicolas Cage,Movies

"In the back of your mind, when you say you want to write music for the movies, you're saying that you want a big house, a big car and a boat. If you just wanted to write music, you could live in Kansas and do it.",Bill Conti,Movies
"Being an actor in TV or movies is different. A film or TV actor, if put in theatre, won't know certain dimensions, while a theatre actor won't know certain things when he comes before the camera. So I think a film actor can learn emoting from this theatre counterpart, while the theatre actor can learn about camera techniques from the film actor.",Barun Sobti,Movies
"I really have to say 'thank you' to our fans, because I think it's difficult for European viewers to find and watch Asian movies, and I hope you enjoy our films.",Alan Mak,Movies
"I'm not a vampire movie fan, per se. That's not to say that I haven't enjoyed movies with vampires in them.",Maggie Q,Movies
"In television, you make an hour-long episode every seven days; we used to make 'Party Down' in four days per episode. It's quick and with independent movies is the same: you gotta keep moving. It's very similar.",Adam Scott,Movies
"Books are up against TV and movies and video games and a multimedia society that is so busy that people don't have contemplative time any more. I worry deeply about this. In fact, I worry about everything all the time. I used to be a punk. All I wanted to do was tear everything down, and that was so much easier.",T. C. Boyle,Movies
"Compared with other Indian film composers, I only write about six movies a year. Others write up to 60.",A. R. Rahman,Movies
"If you think about movies that are adapted from books, they never feel like enough. There's always too much cut out in the end. You either make a five hour movie or you leave out stuff that should be in there.",Jeremy Sisto,Movies

You're creating new things in movies and people are going to steal them.,Daniel Craig,Movies

"My movies are very often violent and dark, but there's a spectrum of light, and that light is coming from the women.",Denis Villeneuve,Movies

"Movies are full of leading men, most of whom aren't working. It's much harder to find a good villain.",Lee Van Cleef,Movies
"The constant is always mythologies and the very first stories that we have.

Those things are eternal.",Brie Larson,Movies
I play tough guys in movies and behaved like one in front of the press because I thought that was what a man did.,Tom Sizemore,Movies

"I recently was in the same room as Leonardo DiCaprio, and one of my favorite movies is 'Basketball Diaries.' That movie hits home for me in so many ways, and in that moment, I was like, 'I have to thank this dude.' So I did.",Barry Keoghan,Movies
"I'll go to the movies and hear 'Angel From Montgomery' in some film, and nobody ever even told me about it. They don't tell you your stuff is going to be in a movie. They don't have to, so they don't tell you. You get paid eventually.",John Prine,Movies
"I said, 'I'm going to the United States to study with Stella Adler and do movies because nobody here has done it and my passion is films.' But I came here and I didn't speak English, I didn't have a green card, I didn't know I had to have an agent, I couldn't drive, I was dyslexic.",Salma Hayek,Movies
"I think that being Jewish has generated an extremely strong sense of the importance of family. If I look at my Scandinavian colleagues, they don't have that urgency about family. All my movies are about that.",Susanne Bier,Movies
The movies that influenced me were movies that told their stories through pictures more than words.,Sam Mendes,Movies
I began to feel that the drama of the truth that is in the moment and in the past is richer and more interesting than the drama of Hollywood movies. So I began looking at documentary films.,Ken Burns,Movies
I think movies lost a lot when they went to stereo and five-track sound.,Sam Raimi,Movies
"Our trials and our times of pain get the most recognition, but 'Straight Outta Compton' speaks to triumph. When it's doubtful, when nobody is on your side, when your back is against the wall, you triumph and make it through. Showing growth through movies promotes growth.","O'Shea Jackson, Jr.",Movies
"Life guided me to being a bodyguard, protecting people, then in the movies, so I'm happy with everything because basically all I ever wanted to do was be a good son and take care of my mother.",Mr. T,Movies
"I think people are sick of trends changing every six months - not because we're tired of them, but just for the sake of change. There is so much junk in the world: junk TV, junk movies, all those junk magazines with the same people on the cover.",Tom Ford,Movies

"I make two movies a year to take care of the butcher and the baker and the school fees. Then I try to write, but it's not that easy. Acting is what's easy.",David Niven,Movies
"When I realized that my big dream was going to come true - 'Night Shift' was a success, 'Splash' was a success, I got the job to do 'Cocoon' - suddenly, I was underway. And I knew my name was rising up the lists. I was going to have a career. I was going to be able to direct movies until I screwed it up.",Ron Howard,Movies
"Our lives are pretty calm. Merging on the freeway in the closest you get to risking your life. So what's missing now is that primal emotion of being scared to death, and I think that's why people crave thrills like roller coasters or scary movies. They give you the chance to feel this very primal emotion in a very controlled environment.",Oren Peli,Movies
"I don't believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesn't have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English, not Spanish. Her success is very important because she represents a different culture, but it doesn't help me.",Salma Hayek,Movies
"In between, I go broke because I seem to do movies where you're not paid a lot as an actor.",Sean Penn,Movies
"You can't think about how people will perceive you or your character. All you can do is focus on your work. The rest is up to the universe. I've been acting for 16 years. I've done 55 movies and, in all seriousness, there's maybe five that are good and the rest are crap.",Robert Patrick,Movies

"All the violence in videos and movies, you can't tell me that that wouldn't influence a disturbed person.",Alana Stewart,Movies
"I've always wanted to be an actress, ever since I was a little girl. I've always played the mom and I play my sister as the daughter. I wanted to be an actress on television and movies instead of just around the house.",Dakota Fanning,Movies
I'm a big fan of the 'Harry Potter' movies and 'The Lord of the Rings' films.,John C. Reilly,Movies
I had to spend a few years learning how to do movies. I wasn't really good at that. I was a theatre actor first and foremost. So I took my time learning that.,Lars Mikkelsen,Movies
"Growing up, I never thought about becoming an actress because I never saw deaf people in TV or movies. I didn't think it was possible.",Millicent Simmonds,Movies
"I'm an outdoorsy guy, but I also enjoy the average teenager stuff - video games, movies, hanging with friends. I'm just a normal guy!",Nathan Kress,Movies
I'm a romantic. I like romantic movies.,Chris Evans,Movies
"Whether it's the experiments on 'MythBusters' or my earlier work in special effects for movies, I've regularly had to do things that were never done before, from designing complex motion-control rigs to figuring out how to animate chocolate.",Adam Savage,Movies
"This kind of stuff, it wasn't the cool thing when I was growing up. Now, pop culture is comic books, super-hero movies, anime, manga, and I've been doing it for a long time.",Mike Daniels,Movies
"The thing about all good horror movies is that the fans expect a couple of inside jokes. Maybe I'm supposed to be saying how terrified I was while making it, but it was really fun.",Margot Kidder,Movies
Hong Kong movies were really popular in my generation.,Gong Yoo,Movies
"I don't think you have to be in these serious, heavy, independent little movies to be an actor. Some of the most interesting acting I've seen is on cable television.",Laura Dern,Movies
"Nina Gold is a fantastic casting director. She's doing the new 'Star Wars' movies, but she also does 'Game of Thrones' and many of the Working Title movies, and she did 'Rush.'",Ron Howard,Movies
I'm not surprised that Spielberg was able to capture the heroism of Schindler; so many of his movies are about the better part of mankind.,Gene Siskel,Movies
"Women like to be scared, but they don't like the blood and the gore, and especially movies that have violence and torture involving women. Women don't want to see that, I can tell you for damn sure right now.",Cassandra Peterson,Movies
"You come out of drama school and do theatre and are interested in creative endeavour, then you drift into TV and movies and realise that artistic endeavour needs to balance with financial success. There's no point spending millions on a movie that doesn't make any money, because the people producing it won't make another one.",Mark Strong,Movies
"Balto' was one of my favorite movies. Balto is the Disney character that's like half-dog, half-wolf. There's a statue of Balto in Central Park.",Evan Fournier,Movies
"Many movies about people recovering, moving on, and redeeming themselves are really wonderful and inspiring. But I think the more sentimental ones that are less good make me feel isolated - like, if you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps like the guys in the movies, there is something wrong with you. That's a shame.",Kenneth Lonergan,Movies
"Las Vegas, New Mexico has had a lot of great movies shot there.",Bill Hader,Movies
I was very driven in high school. I worked a bunch of odd jobs. I never partied. I never drank. I was just a theater geek who was obsessed with movies.,Aaron Paul,Movies
I think less is more when it comes to kissing in the movies.,Julia Roberts,Movies
"I saw 'A Clockwork Orange' when I was 11. When you watch 'Clockwork Orange' at 11, it either totally scares you from watching movies, or you want to become a filmmaker. I was the latter.",Bill Hader,Movies
"Whatever movies I sign, they have to get me out of my comfort zone. Otherwise, I would get bored very easily.",Vir Das,Movies
"'Bonnie and Clyde,' while one of the best movies ever made, was far more interested in portraying Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker as romantic anti-establishment Robin Hoods than what they really were: white-trash spree killers.",Bryan Burrough,Movies
"Acting is a great way to make a living, especially when I consider what my alternatives were and probably still are. I mean, you are only making movies. It is a lot less pressure than being a surgeon; although it seemed like the only other thing that I was qualified for was manual labour.",James Spader,Movies
"I never think it's right to chew gum in front of other people, but a lot of times I'll come in for a meeting chewing gum and I'll forget I'm chewing it. Then you don't want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something, so I've asked to throw it away. I've started to wonder if that's why I didn't get certain movies.",Jennifer Lawrence,Movies
"The woman who made those movies, that's not me. She's someone else.",Brigitte Bardot,Movies
"Because movies have gotten so expensive, and they're so expensive to market, that means that for a movie to break even or to make its money back, everybody has to go see the movie, and if everybody has to go see the movie, then it can't be about anything.",Robert Zemeckis,Movies
"I love beautiful black-and-white movies - anything Bette Davis, especially 'Now', 'Voyager', 'Casablanca', 'Mildred Pierce'; anything by Orson Welles, Truffaut, or Godard; and 'Paper Moon' by Peter Bogdanovich.",Suzan-Lori Parks,Movies
Movies can be instruments of enlightenment.,Marianne Williamson,Movies
"It was considered oh, not proper for children to go to the movies.",Kitty Carlisle,Movies
"Early on in my career, when I had basically been a sitcom actor for all of these years, and I made my first movies, and they were comedies, and they were successes, it was very important for me to stretch, and 'Parenthood' was one of those films. Even though it was a comedy, there was a great deal of authentic drama in the piece as well.",Ron Howard,Movies
"I still haven't quite caught on to the idea of writing without dialogue. I like writing dialogue, and there's nothing wrong with dialogue in movies.",Kenneth Lonergan,Movies
"I remember watching 'Avengers 1' for the first time and thinking, 'God, one day I want to be in one of those movies.' I just want to be in the movie.",Tom Holland,Movies
"I don't want to be a part of the demographics. I want to be an individual. I wear each of my films as a badge of pride. That's why I cherish all my bad reviews. If the critics start liking my movies, then I'm in deep trouble.",John Carpenter,Movies
I don't want to only make the movies that studios will greenlight.,Ron Howard,Movies
"I grew up going to the movies, not watching them on television, so I'm still a bit resistant to TV as a medium.",Kenneth Lonergan,Movies
Most movies aren't any good.,Tom Sizemore,Movies
"If you want to be an actor, you must have total, ruthless commitment to your art. Don't be ambitious for fame or TV or movies. Art is a jealous mistress and will brook no competitors. Study all the time. Never stop reading. Never stop learning speeches. It will fill you up - define and refine you.",Steven Berkoff,Movies
"If someone fires a gun in a movie, it should always be a big deal. I don't like movies where someone shoots at someone else but they just run away and manage to dodge the bullet. Or people are all firing at each other continuously for 10 minutes.",Shane Black,Movies
"Well, I think that when you direct a movie or write it. And in the case of the two movies I did, I wrote and directed, they occupy a special place for you.",Sean Penn,Movies
"The use of violence in movies is a subject that's worth addressing. I'm not standing on a soapbox or wagging a finger, but I'm interested in those subjects for sure.",Naomi Watts,Movies
Where would heist movies be without the Big Score - that payoff so irresistible it can lure the most jaded desperado out of hiding?,Dave Itzkoff,Movies
"'A Christmas Carol' and 'It's a Wonderful Life,' are movies we love with magic in them.",Marc Platt,Movies
"In primary school when I was 6-7 years old, I always go to theater with my uncle, and I don't know why I like the atmosphere, dark only. The screen has some lighting, that kind of things, you can see the movie star and so that's why I like movies.",Andrew Lau,Movies
"There are a lot of movies that I don't care about, especially not remakes.",John Carpenter,Movies
"I have my problems with 'Singles'. To me, 'Singles' is the least successful of the movies I've been lucky enough to make.",Cameron Crowe,Movies
"I don't want to just make horror movies; I don't want to just make any type of movie - I don't just like horror movies, I love movies.",Rob Zombie,Movies
I realise how important it is to use the time I have. I respect people who want to do that by watching television. I happen to want to read books. But I know I can't read all the books or watch all the movies in one lifetime.,Viggo Mortensen,Movies
"Everything can change, but Indian movies will not change much because we're so used to the dance and songs and everything. Even Americans are getting very attracted to all this.",Madhuri Dixit,Movies
"Honestly, I really, really love making movies. It's so much fun, and I love losing myself in the moment and just being there with other actors. When you're truly in the moment and you're feeding each other, it's such an exciting thing to be a part of.",Liam Hemsworth,Movies
I've never seen the two 'Ghostbuster' movies.,Mia Goth,Movies
"Some movies work really well with music from Bach or Mahler that existed long before the film, so music has its own autonomy.",Ennio Morricone,Movies
"El Santo's movies were kind of out there, but Mil Mascaras did the more reality-based type sci-fi movies. You could say he was one of the first to open the notion for those that subscribe to the mentality that this is sports-entertainment.",Rey Mysterio,Movies
"Certain movies like 'Wag The Dog,' we used improv on every scene that we did. Pretty much, we would shoot from the script and then some stuff that we came up with in rehearsal, and then we'd have at least one or two takes where we completely went off the script and just flew by the seat of our pants.",Denis Leary,Movies
"When we were doing 'Freaks and Geeks', I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me. I thought I was helping the other actors by keeping them on their toes, but nobody appreciated it when I would trip them up. So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.",James Franco,Movies
"In the '60s, I was teaching humanities at a college in upstate New York and trying to publish a novel I'd written in graduate school. But nothing was happening. So I moved to New York City and got a job as a messenger at a place that made movies.",Wes Craven,Movies
"I think my sensibility is very literary; all my books were built as books, and I wasn't thinking about them being movies.",Bret Easton Ellis,Movies
"Our ethos for 'Now You See Me 2' was that everything in the movie at least had the potential to be done in real life, and I'd say over 90% of it was actually done in-camera with no CGI. Of course, movies like this are always going to be bound by the rules of Hollywood, being there's going to be enhancements of CGI.",Keith Barry,Movies
What bugs me is that movies don't reflect how interesting and vibrant women are. We don't treasure women as they get older.,Jill Clayburgh,Movies
My only problem is that I'm too sensitive about my movies. I feel each of them has to work and consider every film as my last one.,Sajid Nadiadwala,Movies
There are a lot of movies made for nobody.,Stan Brakhage,Movies
"Originally, theater was my life. It was what I assumed I'd spend my working life doing - if I was lucky. Then along came movies.",Alan Rickman,Movies
"'Avatar' was gorgeous. There are good stories in there, but when used in other movies they're similar to those violent video games. Characters using deadly weapons. The children follow these movies.","Louis Gossett, Jr.",Movies

I do not quote my own movies. I think I would be pretty insufferable if I did.,Diablo Cody,Movies
"If I have a spare second, I usually catch up on the many magazines I'm behind on or watch the latest movies on demand that I usually missed at the theater. I love magazines.

"I have a lot of Chinese fans who buy my movies on the street and watch them, and I'm OK with it. I'm not OK with it in other places, but if the government's going to censor me, then I want the people to see it in any way they can.",Quentin Tarantino,Movies
"When it comes to casting for movies, it is a priority that you cast right. The guiding principle must be what is right for the movie, that is the basis you cast someone, not because so-and-so is a friend.",Mani Ratnam,Movies
"Television has its own award. It's called the Emmy. It's a good award. I like it. I have one. But you don't see movies like 'The King's Speech' win Oscars and then go to TV and qualify for Emmys. In documentaries, some networks have been able to game the system.",Michael Moore,Movies
"There is a heavy Mexican Catholic streak in my movies, and a huge Mexican sense of melodrama. Everything is overwrought, and there's a sense of acceptance of the fantastic in my films, which is innately Mexican. So when people ask, 'How can you define the Mexican-ness of your films?' I go, 'How can I not?' It's all I am.",Guillermo del Toro,Movies
Books are a little better movies than just screenplays because there's more fat on the bone. There's more character development. There's more stuff to pick from.,Mike Binder,Movies
"I'm such a theater geek. Most of my friends are in this community, and it's really important for me to keep doing it. It takes the ego out of acting, whereas movies tend to involve it.",Ari Graynor,Movies

"I didn't know this about myself, but when 'Pirates of the Caribbean' came out I realised that I didn't enjoy a huge amount of recognition. I didn't react to it well, but I think life is about finding out who you are and what you like. So I started doing independent movies and art-house films instead.",Keira Knightley,Movies
"Basically, it was important to break the belief that commercial filmmakers can't make realistic movies. I broke it.",Priyadarshan,Movies

"I drove from Naples to the Amalfi coast in an Alpha Romeo 1969 Spider, which was lovely. There have been lots of movies made down there, and I felt a bit like James Bond - the driving is quite hairy. The locals have mopeds, but you wouldn't catch me on a bike on those roads. A tank would be safer!",Paul Hollywood,Movies

"I want to do more movies, more adult roles.",Peyton List,Movies
"Movies make teenagers have quippy answers for every question. Nothing seems to faze them, and they're like, 'Oh, whatever.' You're not like that when you're a teenager. You're really earnest. Things really feel like life or death. And you kind of oscillate between emotions at one time. It's very emotionally draining being a teenager.",Bel Powley,Movies
None of my movies are autobiographical.,Susanne Bier,Movies
"One thing I was thinking about the other day was you can't even conceive of the kinds of things you can do in movies today. The idea that you could draw, in a computer, dinosaurs and have them running around was totally impossible.",John Badham,Movies

I've always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse.,Jodie Foster,Movies

I loved movies ever since I was a kid.,Roger Deakins,Movies

"If you were to stand on an asteroid in the main belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter in our solar system, you might be able to see one or two asteroids in the sky, but they would be very far away and very, very small. So you wouldn't have this 'dodging through tons of rocks' business you get in the movies.",Carrie Nugent,Movies
"I won't go to movies with permissiveness, four-letter words, or violence. Show me 'E.T.' and 'Chariots of Fire' instead. That's entertainment, not exploitation of the human body.",Ginger Rogers,Movies
A written word gets preserved in so many forms. But movies which comprise of both audio and visuals have to be done with care and a lot more details.,Mani Ratnam,Movies
"It's hard to really get that excited about movies. Think about it like this: how many good comedy movies come out a year? Maybe one or two? And then, in those movies, what are the chances that there's a character that I'm the best fit to play? It's really small!",Aziz Ansari,Movies
"I don't know if she should worry too much, I mean some of our greatest writers have had movies made of their books, lots of Hemingway novels were turned into movies, it doesn't hurt the book.",Paul Auster,Movies
I can't be the villain that I play in the movies.,Rahul Dev,Movies

"If you want to write for T.V. and movies, you will be subjected to kind and unkind criticism. You had better get used to it and develop a shell.",Anne Beatts,Movies

"Since Star Wars, that film's success led to bigger budgets, more hardware, that the great movies like the ones I did, which were studio movies, are now independent movies. They range from half a million to several million, and a lot of those have very interesting roles.",Faye Dunaway,Movies

"Actually, I look the same in real life as I do in the movies.",Andy Lau,Movies
"I need to make the characters that I play in movies more accessible to audiences, more real. As an actor, you're always passive; you're not making that many choices, so when something allows you to open up a bit, you want to explore your newfound freedom.",Shu Qi,Movies
"Economically, it's more expensive to make movies. I hope digital movies change that.",Ang Lee,Movies
"Other filmmakers make their movies and put them out and that's that. For me, for some odd reason, it goes deeper than that.",Kevin Smith,Movies
"I go to movies with my children and see fat kids burping, parents portrayed as total morons, and kids being mean and materialistic, and I feel it's really slim pickin's out there. There's a little dribble of a moral tacked on, but the story is not about that.",Melissa Mathison,Movies
"The problem with my mind is it sways from side to side. The idea of me fantasizing about becoming an actor quickly led to depression. 'No, it was never going to happen to me.' I was a sixteen-year-old kid on the other side of the world from where they made movies. Scottish actors never really got play. There was Sean Connery, and that was it.",Gerard Butler,Movies
I really don't have any solutions and I don't like movies that do.,Charlie Kaufman,Movies
"Changes are not unusual - I mean, most movies, when they release them, they make changes. But somehow, when I make the slightest change, everybody thinks it's the end of the world.",George Lucas,Movies
"There are so many things we have not seen in 'Spider-Man' yet... I want to use bad guys never seen in movies. The first films were so traditional and so scrupulously followed the character's classic plot... So there's a lot of stuff left in stock. 'The Clone Saga,' for example.",Tom Holland,Movies
"I never really worked with Chris Farley, I hung out with him, but I had plans, I had big plans, movies, and I was in no hurry.",Andy Dick,Movies
There's a generation of children who don't like black and white movies. There's a level of impatience or intolerance now.,Peter Jackson,Movies

I got into this business because I like acting and I want to make movies. I would be happy living the rest of my life never famous.,Scott Eastwood,Movies
"We've been shooting the last two weeks with a lot of vampires. I don't want to give away too much, but if you've read the books, it's the standoff with lots of vampires in play. There's like 70 people going through the works at once. It's a little maddening, but fun. We shot pretty much the ending of the two movies the other day.",Peter Facinelli,Movies
"I want people to think about movies and how we watch them. Let them know it's okay to question the structure or how we're sometimes duped into a false sense of normalcy. Most of all, I want people to question the old standard practices of, 'This is how the structure of something should work,' or, 'This is how a character must behave.'",Tim Heidecker,Movies
"When you come to America, it's a very serious thing. It's not like you arrive and they say, 'Hey, come on! Do movies!' I can't just be hopping around. I have to focus and be still and make sure that I put the time and effort in. Because if I don't, I could lose it like that.",Maggie Q,Movies

"I was dirt-poor. I could barely hold down a job. Eventually, though, I started getting small parts on shows like 'Smallville,' 'Supernatural'... and lots of really bad sci-fi movies. I was running around the woods in wolf contacts, covered in fake blood made out of pancake syrup, roaring.",Cory Monteith,Movies
"In some movies you feel like you're a very small part of a huge machine. Whereas in the theater you can have a very small part, but you can still feel the weight and the gravity of it. Given the nature of theater, it's a more concentrated and quiet experience.",Minnie Driver,Movies
"I've played heavies for years and years and years. I was bald. I came to Hollywood. I did a play about junk. I was a pusher, so I played pushers for years and years and years. I did war movies and things like that.",Gavin MacLeod,Movies
There's a difference between actresses of color and actresses not of color. If you look at how big my movies are.,Regina King,Movies
"I don't watch the movies I make, so I haven't seen 'Footloose' since it came out. You see this young, hungry actor, it's pretty fun. I was the only one they screen tested. It was an attempt by the director and producer to talk the head of the studio into hiring me because they didn't want me.",Kevin Bacon,Movies
"With horror movies, a bigger budget is actually your enemy. You want to feel the rough edges, the handmade quality to good horror films. It's a genre that benefits from not having everything at your disposal.",Drew Goddard,Movies
I started in movies in Mexico and started doing telenovelas in Mexico. 'American Family' was the first thing I did in English.,Kate del Castillo,Movies
"A woman wants to be romanced. She wants to be an essential part of a great adventure; she wants a beauty to unveil. That is what little girls play at, and those are the movies women love and the stories that they love.",John Eldredge,Movies
"I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.",Sydney Pollack,Movies
"At Pixar, we've been huge fans of any new technology that makes the viewer experience of our movies better. Blu-ray is the best yet because the picture quality, especially for our movies, is unbelievable.",John Lasseter,Movies
"I think us gals need to stay in and just change the way it works, so men aren't being workaholics and avoiding life and relationships, and they can make films in a reasonable amount of time, so you can have a family and a life outside of work. And have more balanced, content-driven, enjoyable movies.",Joan Cusack,Movies
"'The Omen,' 'The Exorcist,' those movies for me are the quintessential horror movies that still scare me as an adult.",Fede Alvarez,Movies

'The Shining' is one of my favorite movies of all time.,Diana Silvers,Movies
I love crying at romantic movies like 'The Notebook.' I'm always bawling.,Fergie,Movies
"I never see my movies. When they're on television, I click them away. Hollywood created an image, and I long ago reconciled myself with it. I was the French cliche.",Louis Jourdan,Movies
I like movies I can relate to.,Kim Cattrall,Movies
"I do love science fiction, but it's not really a genre unto itself; it always seems to merge with another genre. With the few movies I've done, I've ended up playing with genre in some way or another, so any genre that's made to mix with others is like candy to me. It allows you to use big, mythic situations to talk about ordinary things.",Rian Johnson,Movies
"Girls may love movies about fairytale princes, but their most captivating romance is with their friends.",Rachel Simmons,Movies
"I don't do isolation body building; I just do practical things that help me with the kind of things that are asked of me in action movies. You know, a lot of kick boxing, a lot of sparring.",Jason Statham,Movies
I love big popcorn movies.,Alicia Vikander,Movies
My adult life is filled with the things horror movies are made of.,Tim Kennedy,Movies

Luis Bunuel made great movies.,Giancarlo Esposito,Movies

"Most of my films have a lot of character development and exploration, whereas in most horror movies the characters are just cardboard.",Larry Cohen,Movies
"We are not outraged by blood. We see blood all the time. Blood is pervasive in movies, television, and video games. Yet, we are outraged by the fact that one openly discusses bleeding from an area that we try to claim ownership over.",Rupi Kaur,Movies
"If I was as tough as I'm made out to be in movies, I wouldn't have to worry.",Burt Reynolds,Movies
Some of my ideas were shot down by Lucasfilm because they stepped on territory that has been reserved for the movies. I didn't have a problem with that.,Walter Jon Williams,Movies
"I learn an amazing amount from watching television and movies because if you watch things that really work and don't work, it teaches you so much about what you do for your own craft. I think that if you're auditioning for a show, you need to know the world of the show, or you can't represent it very well.",Lauren Stamile,Movies
"When I was a girl, there wasn't anything in Spanish in the movies until you saw it on DVD.",Eiza Gonzalez,Movies
"I like most of the Humphrey Bogart movies because they had to act then, and they acted very well. Edward G. Robinson is probably the best actor I've ever seen on the movies.",Patrick Macnee,Movies
"Scary movies, for me, I used to be insanely scared of.",Finn Wolfhard,Movies
"I have watched the movies of the 1980s on TV. At times, I feel that I should have lived in that era.",Kalyani Priyadarshan,Movies

I don't make movies for pseudo-intellectuals. I don't want them to watch my films.,Priyadarshan,Movies
"'In A World...' changed my life a thousand per cent. I feel thankful that something I believed in so much - I love dialect, so I dedicated five years of my life to making a film about it - yielded such rewards. It led to 'Man Up,' as well as 'No Escape,' which comes out later this year... two movies where I am the female lead.",Lake Bell,Movies
"I had some great times doing competitions, but I have always been more into making movies because making movies is more about art and expressing yourself in a creative way.",Candide Thovex,Movies
I never dreamed in a million years that 'The Lord of the Rings' would be nominated for an Oscar. Those types of fantasy movies never got nominations.,Peter Jackson,Movies
"'AVP' is not trying to be 'Alien' or 'Aliens,' and it's not trying to be 'Predator.' Those are genius movies.",Paul W. S. Anderson,Movies
"You are defined by who you are, by your choices in life, in all regards, not just in doing movies.",Andy Garcia,Movies
"Movies these days have made killers into funny people. What's that all about? I've got kids and family and friends, and I don't like bad things. I don't think they're funny, and it's irresponsible to make movies that don't show you how that's not good.",Billy Bob Thornton,Movies
