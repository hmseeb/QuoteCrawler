"I played sports. The acting thing was just a direct blessing from the Lord, because I lost my discipline to play sports, and I had this really cool professor grab me and kind of take me under his wing, and the ball just started rolling.

There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time. And I'd say the same thing about poetry and gardening. Gardening slows me down. I want to stop and observe everything.,Ross Gay,Sports
"The world of extreme sports is also one of big business. Kids might think that snowboarding is the ultimate freedom, but this freedom is being marketed to them by commercial sponsors.",Lucy Walker,Sports

"I'm a visual thinker, really bad at algebra. There's others that are a pattern thinker. These are the music and math minds. They think in patterns instead of pictures.

I am very slow to warm. I've always been sort of a loner. I didn't play team sports. I am better one-on-one than in big groups.,Rooney Mara,Sports
Owning a popular sports team is very different than any other type of business. They don't throw parades when Apple has the biggest quarter in corporate history.

"They read their sports pages, know their statistics and either root like hell or boo our butts off. I love it. Give me vocal fans, pro or con, over the tourist types who show up in Houston or Montreal and just sit there.",Mike Schmidt,Sports
"It is the toughest, most macho of male sports, and with that comes an image. In many ways, it is barbaric, and I could never have come out without first establishing myself and earning respect as a player. Rugby was my passion, my whole life, and I wasn't prepared to risk losing everything I loved.",Gareth Thomas,Sports
"When I'm playing football, it's what I know; it's what I'm good at. The spotlight is not just on you: you're with 10 of your team-mates.

It's important for schools to encourage sports.,P. T. Usha,Sports
"I was always one of those people who would watch the Super Bowl as much for the sports as I did for the ads. I was always just sort of fascinated by the fact that when you turn on the TV, there was motion, there was moving pictures on it.",Andrew Ross Sorkin,Sports

"Anything can happen. That's why sports are so great, the unexpected.",Cody Bellinger,Sports
"When I'm doing sports, I don't feel anything at all. I enjoy the moment. It's a safe haven. But once you try to let someone inside your soul, you become vulnerable.
