"Ministers should not pray so loud, and long, as to exhaust the strength. It is not necessary to weary the throat and lungs in prayer.

"If one has the answers to all the questions - that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself.

"I don't think you should spend your life praying for things, but I do believe you should thank God for what He's given you... but I think the scripture teaches us that we can pray for our dreams, pray for the big things... he's not a small God; this God is incredible.",Joel Osteen,God
