Koerner,Teen
"By the time I was a teen, I was an expert at scanning people's faces, always in search of eyes like mine. I devoured glossy magazines, ever mindful of the language we used to talk about beauty.

"I watch a lot of teen TV and read a lot of YA novels. I also talk to teens whenever I can. There are cultural differences between when I was a teen and now, but emotions - anger, angst, love - are the same.",Sarah Mlynowski,Teen
"I'm excited to see a new age of rom-coms, and especially teen romantic comedies, because when I was younger, I was watching 'Harry Potter' and 'Hunger Games' and stuff like that.

"I think if you ask people why they watch me, there would be some common thread among all of them that I'm somewhat of an awkward older sister. I have a teen, mostly female demographic.

"When I was a teen, I was never really into the captain of the football team or the student body president. The guys I liked were quirky and different: They listened to music I'd never heard of, never had lunch or gas money, and could always make you laugh.",Sarah Dessen,Teen

It's only shocking to the uninitiated that 'Teen Vogue' would have the audacity to be political and style-focused.,Elaine Welteroth,Teen
"You need to know what makes artists tick. Having been through the process myself as a musician, since I was an early teen, gave me an advantage - understanding them from their point of view, because it's about them, it's not about you - it's their vision and what they're capable of achieving, and you're the conduit.",Tommy Mottola,Teen
Teen movies often have an unspoken underlying premise in which high school is seen as less serious than the adult world. But when your head is encased in that microcosm it's the most serious time of your life.,Rian Johnson,Teen

"I can have a song with Ariana Grande that is going to be the song for all the kids and the teen girls, and then another song that could be for a different group of people who all love the song. I'm with whoever. Whatever type of people want to love the music and whatever they love about the music is fine with me.",Mac Miller,Teen
"I think that, oftentimes, what people say is, 'We need an actress who'll be able to greenlight a movie,' and my counterargument to that is always that, when it comes to a teen movie, you have very few people who can greenlight a movie.",Jenny Han,Teen
"They were marketing me as a teen idol, when the stuff on the record was not what teen idols were doing at the time.",Rick Springfield,Teen

"'Teen Vogue' is so much more than just a magazine. It's so much more than just a website. It's so much more than social. It's really about the audience, and so we're going to continue to innovate and continue to find new ways of reaching this audience in meaningful ways.",Elaine Welteroth,Teen
My first encounter with Cyborg was through the 'Teen Titans' cartoon.,Ray Fisher,Teen
"I played teen roles until high definition came out, and I could never understand it. I would go in for adult roles and be older than many of the people auditioning, but they'd cast the girl without a line on her face.",Selma Blair,Teen
"There's no greater challenge, for most parents, than letting a growing teen go out into the world, knowing he is exposed to risk, but that it is also your duty to let him go.",Susanna Reid,Teen
"I went on an audition once for a show, and the feedback was to play an angry teen. My agent convinced me to try out. I was really bitter for a while, because it sucks when you don't get good scripts after working on good quality.",Alia Shawkat,Teen
"Without exaggeration, hyperbole or conflict of interest, 'On My Block' is the best teen show in the history of teen shows.",Jason Johnson,Teen

"Being a musician since I was a teen, Guitar Center is the staple. You need anything to create, it's there. You need a Guitar Center. You gotta give it homage. It's a tool shed, and without the tool shed, it's hard to create.",Steve Aoki,Teen

I built my entire career off of teen comedies. I was in 'Bring It On'.,Kirsten Dunst,Teen
"Teen problem novels? I can go through them like a box of chocolates. And there are fantasy books out now that need a lot more editing. Fantasy got to be so popular that people began to think 'We don't need to be as diligent with the razor blade,' but they do.",Tamora Pierce,Teen

"'Teen Wolf' ending is, like, huge. I know no acting without the show, basically.",Dylan O'Brien,Teen
"There's always a Justin Bieber. Ever since I've been around, there's always been one of him.

There's a few of them that make it out and a few of them that don't.",Kid Rock,Teen

"'Teen Moms!' I started watching them like the first two seasons, and I stopped. I stopped because they are too young. I feel sorry for them. And I didn't watch that show 'Hoarders.' That thing would made my skin crawl.",NeNe Leakes,Teen
"I didn't know what was going to happen with 'Teen Wolf.' I was only scheduled to do four episodes for them, but they kept me on, and I was like, 'Sweet! I'm still employed! That's awesome!'

Teen drug use went up dramatically in the 1990s.,John Walters,Teen
"Ever since I was a little teen, I was told by my great-grandma that you've got to always have a good moisturizer.

"People still come up to me and say, 'Hey, 'Teen Wolf!' 'Teen Wolf Too' closed a week after it opened. Where did they see it?",Jason Bateman,Teen
"My writing books with positive gay characters has come more out of anger than anything else: anger at not having been able to find honest, accurate books about people like myself as a teen, books that show we're as diverse as straight people and that we can lead happy, healthy, productive lives just as straight people can.",Nancy Garden,Teen
"As a teen, I enjoyed Sufi music and ghazals the most. But as my career began, I drifted off to playback and other streams over the years.",Chinmayi,Teen

"I've started ordering out of teen catalogues! T-shirts, little coats, and jackets for around $35 - they're amazing. I've become a really big fan of Urban Outfitters, Alloy and Anthropologie. Because I'll pay for quality, but I will not just pay for trend. Psychologically, I have trouble with that.",Ivanka Trump,Teen
I actually hope people don't react to 'Impossible' in a way where they think it's terribly retro. The plot needed to do what it needed to do. But I'm a little surprised to find myself looking a little bit like an advocate of teen marriage. It takes some exceptional circumstances for that to be a reasonable idea.,Nancy Werlin,Teen
I'm really good at making teen angst romantic. I'm really good at dealing with heartbreak and things like that and making it into this whole experience. But there's no way to make someone-on-the-Internet-said-something-mean-about-me into romantic angst where you can listen to music and cry or whatever.,Tavi Gevinson,Teen
What's great about teen fiction is that it's all mixed up - there's highbrow and lowbrow!,Kaui Hart Hemmings,Teen

Just because you have teenagers in a movie doesn't make it a teen movie.,Brendan Fehr,Teen
"Certain elements of teen life that, 10 years ago, were very important to me still, are becoming less so as I get older. I mean, I've kinda gotten over, I guess I'm saying, the fact that I had trouble getting a date for the prom.",Matthew Tobin Anderson,Teen
"If a movie isn't a hit right out of the gate, they drop it. Which means that the whole mainstream Hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy.",Roger Ebert,Teen

"I was a total metal-head as a teen. I still love it, too.",Kristian Nairn,Teen
"I love being in a public space where teenagers are talking. And the funny thing is that it hasn't changed that much. There's certainly slang that I'm not familiar with, but among the average teen, it's still the same.",Marti Noxon,Teen
"For me, the teen years were all about searching for a place for myself, wondering why I seemed so different than everyone else, wondering especially why no one could look past the surface and figure out who I really was underneath.",Robin Wasserman,Teen

"I've always enjoyed teen characters, and kids as well. For whatever reason, I seem to have an ability to do it sort of well, and I enjoy doing it.",Jeff Lemire,Teen
"I think the feeling was that 'Venture Brothers' really has something to sell in terms of a feature. 'Aqua Teen' is an element minute cartoon, and its very subversive and non sequitur and weird. We were writing the one show where we were constantly like, 'God, I wish we had another hour to tell this story.' It seemed like a natural fit.",Christopher McCulloch,Teen
"We don't tend to write about disease in fiction - not just teen novels but all American novels - because it doesn't fit in with our idea of the heroic romantic epic. There is room only for sacrifice, heroism, war, politics and family struggle.",John Green,Teen
"Before I even got signed as a teen, I was singing with people like Hoyt Axton and Mickey Gilley. I worked with Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard.",Tiffany Darwish,Teen
"One of the things that 'Love, Simon' is doing that hasn't been done before is it's a gay teen rom-com with a mainstream wide release and the backing of a studio that previous gay rom-coms have not had. I'm really excited by that.",Becky Albertalli,Teen
I started bumming around when I was a teen.,Johnny Paycheck,Teen
Jockeying for a popularity position has been a valorized teen tradition since the notion of a discrete teen stage of life was invented.,Mary H.K. Choi,Teen
"We left Egypt when I was seven, and we didn't return until I was 21. My teen years were divided between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia.

I never listened to the Grateful Dead as a teen; the only exposure I got was what came through the walls when my sister was listening to them.,J. K. Simmons,Teen
"I first read Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as a teen in school, like you did. I read the book alone, eating lunch at my locker, neatly scored oranges my mother divided into five lines with a circle at the top, so my fingers could dig more easily into the orange skin. To this day, the smell of oranges reminds me of 'Mockingbird.'",Margaret Stohl,Teen
"Guilty pleasure implies that it's something that I feel guilty for watching... people tell me I should feel guilty for watching because I'm too old to watch it, but I don't give a damn: I love everything on Cartoon Network from 'Adventure Time' to 'The Adventures of Gumball', 'Teen Titans'... all those shows that are for my kids, I like those!",Ne-Yo,Teen

I was a happy kid up until I hit the teen years.,Rick Springfield,Teen
"Lesley Gore's part-time field was pop singer, and in her brief but urgent prime, she was the Queen of Teen Angst.

"It's easy to feel like you don't have any control over yourself or your life or your body as a teen - everything is changing so fast, and a lot of it feels so outside of your power. I think that's why a lot of teens form really strong attachments to fictional characters or celebrities, draw their own characters or write themselves into fan fiction.",Noelle Stevenson,Teen
I was a troubled teen and I was constantly looking for someone to throw me a rope. Those ropes are connections. They allow us to see that life exists beyond the little worlds we are currently a part of.,Lauren Oliver,Teen
"I'm a teen boy, so I like seeing blood and guts. I know it's fake, but I'm having fun.",Chandler Riggs,Teen
I think teen girls will like 'Geek Charming' because they really focus on the 'populars' and nerdy people and people who are in between the nerds and between the populars. So it really hits every category of what girls are going through in high school.,Lili Simmons,Teen
"People ask me, 'How's 'Teen Wolf?' and I tell them it's literally the best job I've ever had. It's hard. Everybody wants to be a series regular. It's something that a lot of actors would kill to have. That being said, it's very demanding of you, in so many different ways.",Shelley Hennig,Teen

"When I was a teen, I would draw a really, really long line around my eyes with eyeliner, like Lola Flores.",Rosalia,Teen
"I used to aspire to being more of a traditional bass player, to be honest. People say I play it like a guitar - and I was a guitar player when I was growing up. I started learning when I was eight, and that's what I was fascinated with in my teen years.",Justin Chancellor,Teen
"I'm so fascinated by the concept of teen pregnancy for some reason. Not that I condone it or promote it, but it's just a very real thing in our country and culture.",Leven Rambin,Teen

"I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school.

"I did work at a mall in college - I think retail/customer service is just one of the most hideous jobs in the world. So I always try to be extra nice when I go into a store.

I instinctively dress a bit tougher because I've spent a lot of time in the U.S. and I realised there was a certain image projected of me here. I've always been an absolute rebel. When I was in my teen years I had piercings and wore all black.,Ellie Goulding,Teen
"When I started out as a music journalist, at the end of the 1980s, it was generally assumed that we were living through the lamest music era the world would ever see. But those were also the years when hip-hop exploded, beatbox disco soared, indie rock took off, and new wave invented a language of teen angst.",Rob Sheffield,Teen
"As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.",Julie Burchill,Teen
To even be called the 'teen queen' is crazy.,Victoria Justice,Teen

"As a unique person, I was bullied badly as a teen.",Lady Starlight,Teen
"I didn't have a teen age at all. I didn't even look at boys, never mind... then suddenly it was like, 'Oh my god!' So I made up for a lot of lost time very quickly. It was kind of bonkers. Working hard, partying hard - but also experiencing life, you know.",Anne-Marie Duff,Teen

"I don't really think I feel pressured to become a teen sensation because that's not really my goal in life. It's not really about being star, being popular or having lots of girls. It's really about continuing to be able to act and have fun, and do what I like to do.",Chris Massoglia,Teen

Watching 'CSI: Miami' is like watching 'Teen Jeopardy!' or doing the crossword puzzle in 'People' magazine. It makes you feel smart even when you're not.,Willie Geist,Teen
"There's a theory about fame: the moment it strikes, it arrests development. Michael Jackson remained suspended in childhood, enjoying sleepovers and funfairs; Winona Ryder, an errant teen who dabbled in shoplifting and experimented with pills; George Clooney, a 30-year-old commitment-phobe, never quite ready yet to settle down.",Jemima Khan,Teen
"I do a lot of teen shows and voice over work for animation, so when I got the part in 'The Number 23,' it was really cool because now I get to be in a movie with Jim Carrey. Acting in this movie was really a learning experience for me.",Paul Butcher,Teen
"I tend to like writing long stories in comics. I worked on 'Flash,' 'Teen Titans' and 'JSA' for years. I always like diving into characters.",Geoff Johns,Teen
"I grew up in a small town in Kansas, so I love meeting the fans. Those are the people who spend time out of their day to watch the things that I've done, and I've gotten to do some great supernatural stuff - 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Gates' before that - so it's nice when I get to go to Comic-Con every year.",Colton Haynes,Teen
I think doing 'Teen Wolf' is just giving me a really great opportunity to possibly get other jobs and show what I can do.,Colton Haynes,Teen
"I've always gravitated towards those ultimate lines in songs, the line you grab on to. That line in 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' 'Here we are now/Entertain us' - the irony, the antagonism; that's always stuck with me.",Corey Taylor,Teen
"I like having young assistants in my office; they have energy, and I spend time with them to make sure they understand what we're doing. By investing in them, I'm investing in the magazine.

I started a MySpace teen lit discussion group and invited people to join.,Sarah Mlynowski,Teen
"As I got older, I had a bunch of friends that were various teen stars. I've always known people in the spotlight and people who just grew up in L.A. and had nothing to do with the industry. It's not a glamorous thing to me. It's just a different type of business.",Troian Bellisario,Teen
"I'm not a teen anymore, but growing up, some of my favorite things were, like, 'Twin Peaks,' which wasn't even really my time, and this is one of the things, like a weird, quirky, small town mystery.",Troian Bellisario,Teen
"In my teen years leading up to the Olympics, I loved having the excuse to skip out on parties because of skating. Partying wasn't my thing anyway. Mostly I hung out with other skaters. We were all buddies, so it's not like I missed out on socializing. I was really enjoying myself.",Dorothy Hamill,Teen
"I will say that I know Nirvana did a show and played a few chords from 'More Than a Feeling' before they did 'Teen Spirit,' and it wasn't very good. But in all seriousness, 'Teen Spirit' was a great song. If subconsciously or somehow I had any influence on that, I'll take that as a compliment.",Tom Scholz,Teen

"I just felt being part of my peer group so strongly. I was immersed in teen culture, but not taken in by it.",S. E. Hinton,Teen

"To be honest, and this is terrible to admit, I hardly read any teen mystery books at all.",John Allison,Teen
"'Pretty Little Liars,' you know, it's a teen show that grew to be something bigger. I think you had girls from ages 7 to, like, 20 watching the show, and that was the predominant audience. Then it grew to be for girls, boys, men, women, people who are 7 to 35. I think that's crazy.",Aeriel Miranda,Teen
"As a kid, I was definitely a DC guy. I started reading big time in the '80s at the height of the Wolfman/Perez 'New Teen Titans.' That was definitely the book that hooked me.",Jason Aaron,Teen
"Can you imagine peaking as a teen? I think if you peak in high school, there's a problem. That's what my sister always said: 'Don't worry, you'll peak later.'",Chelsea Handler,Teen
"I don't usually like teen novels written in the present tense, particularly those told from a first-person viewpoint. Too many writers seem to believe that using either or both devices automatically imbues their stories with deep seriousness and a contemporary feel.",Tony Bradman,Teen

"As a white teen, I was very drawn to hip-hop culture, almost to the point of disappearing in it - there was a sense of having no sense of authenticity except this one that wasn't mine.",Jess Row,Teen
"In the public, it seems to be painted that when minorities get pregnant, they need to get abortions, especially when it comes to teen pregnancy. It's like, when black girls are pregnant, it's like a statistic, but when white girls get pregnant, they get a TV show.",Benjamin Watson,Teen
"Fifth grade was when I first heard 'Smells Like Teen Spirit;' it was the energy, and his voice. I liked 311 and Sublime, too, though that might have been a little after that.",Ty Dolla Sign,Teen

"The eight months I took off between 'Teen Vogue' and 'Lucky' afforded me such amazing opportunities, and I learned so much from so many different people - the brands that I worked with, the companies that I was consulting for.",Eva Chen,Teen
"I so think it's limiting to define an audience ahead of time. This is something I've brought on myself by being like, 'There are no 'real' teen publications! That's what I'll do!' But then it's like, well, if I want 'Rookie' to be successful and popular, then people will invalidate the realness by saying it's popular and mainstream.",Tavi Gevinson,Teen
"'Rookie' is not your guide to Being a Teen. It is, quite simply, a bunch of writing and art we like and believe in.",Tavi Gevinson,Teen

"It seems like whenever a big newspaper or TV show talks about teen literature, they focus on dark books or vampire books. It's kind of this cliche. It seems like the only time adults pay attention is with that angle.",Jay Asher,Teen
My first break was becoming a staff writer on the rebooted '90210.' And then I got stuck writing in the teen genre for a while.,Allison Schroeder,Teen
I pass on a lot of teen roles that get sent to me because a lot of the time it doesn't feel real. It's sugar-coated. There's no depth to it.,Dylan Minnette,Teen
"The endless teen franchises that come out of Hollywood... more often than not, the central character doesn't have any discernible character traits. They're just the young, good-looking guy who goes on this journey. They're always played by fantastic young actors, but ultimately, they're not very interesting characters.",Taron Egerton,Teen
"How the original 'Cosmos' affected me personally was long-term. I wasn't born early enough to see the original series, but after getting a hold of it in my teen years, it was one of the driving forces behind my passion for science.",Kyle Hill,Teen
People don't know the real me. The hard times I went through are what led me to my life now. I was a mess as a teen! I was kind of wild and really unhappy.,Kristin Cavallari,Teen
I was considered chubby as a teen.,Roger Moore,Teen
"There's a freshness to the approach of teen chefs. They're lighthearted, and they're not afraid to take risks.",Alex Guarnaschelli,Teen
Ric Flair was such a huge part of my childhood and teen years. He's an icon.,Darius Rucker,Teen
"I've got some great stuff in my sports memorabilia collection. But my favorite thing by far is the robe. I actually have a Ric Flair robe with 'the Nature Boy' on the back. That's awesome. When I look at it, it brings back so many memories of my childhood and my teen years.",Darius Rucker,Teen

"If you're interested in a 'Teen Vogue' internship, take note: it's not all fun and games! Working at a magazine requires a ton of energy and endurance from its interns and editors alike.",Emily Weiss,Teen
"By no means do we think, 'Oh, it's cool to be a teen mom.' I definitely don't think that it's cool.",Farrah Abraham,Teen
"I didn't know too much about his comic book history. I know that in 'Teen Titans,' he's much more the comedic relief. But after reading the comic book iteration of Cyborg in 'The New Teen Titans' from the 1980s that Marv Wolfman and George Perez had worked on, I saw that there was a lot of texture to the character.",Ray Fisher,Teen
I kept getting offered all this young adult stuff. I don't want to keep telling teen coming-of-age stories!,Dee Rees,Teen
"There was so much pressure to fit in, I tried to force myself to be like everyone else. The last thing any teen wants is to be 'uncool.'",GRiZ,Teen
"If you have a famous parent, you know that being famous doesn't make you superior to anyone else. It just means people smile at you more. Everyone was fawning all over my father, but of course, the way you look at your parents when you're a teen is often with a... more critical eye.",Katherine Waterston,Teen
"My top goal as your Secretary of State is to save lives by reducing fatal traffic crashes. When I established the Teen Driver Safety Task Force, the goal was to improve Illinois' graduated driver licensing law and, even more importantly, to save lives.",Jesse White,Teen
"Even with the beauty stories we put out, we saw there was an opportunity to address issues of representation, identity, self-expression. We created the community that we wanted to have at 'Teen Vogue.' We were willing to lose some to have more.",Elaine Welteroth,Teen
"'Teen Vogue' fortunately has proved you can have smart, political, and fashionable content delivered in one place, and you don't have to choose.",Elaine Welteroth,Teen
"As a teen, every major moment was preempted by a torturous, hours-long hair-straightening session. Sleek, silky strands made me feel prettier. And the truth is, I was completely clueless about how to deal with my curls! When they weren't flatironed into submission for special occasions, they were practically glued down with gobs of gel.",Elaine Welteroth,Teen
I grew up as an avid reader. I would go to the library and check out 40 books a week. Some of them were smarty books; most of them were 'Sweet Valley High' and young teen romance.,Julie Plec,Teen

"As a teenager, I didn't read a ton of teen fiction, and now I feel like I wish that I had.",Jesse Andrews,Teen
I love telling teen stories where the characters are experiencing things for the first time - the stakes feel really high.,Stephanie Savage,Teen
I'll write teen stories as long as people will let me. I'll also be excited for the day when I'm told I can no longer write teen stories.,Stephanie Savage,Teen
'Awkward' is a ubiquitous teen word to denote socially unsanctioned behavior. It usually implies first- or secondhand embarrassment when you or a friend step outside the rules. Awkward doesn't sound overtly judgmental or negative; it's deliberately vague.,Mary H.K. Choi,Teen
"I have cystic acne, and sometimes when I have a breakout, it triggers me back to that time when I was a teen and I feel so self-conscious - like the whole world is looking at my bad skin. I've definitely not gone out of the house because of a breakout, which is horrible.",Lili Reinhart,Teen
"With any teen show, there's going to be drama and heartache.",Lili Reinhart,Teen
The best thing I can say about 'Teen Wolf Too' is that it's the only time anyone ever referred to me as Preston Sturges. Leonard Maltin wrote that 'Teen Wolf Too' made 'Teen Wolf' look like Preston Sturges. I've always prided myself on that.,Jeph Loeb,Teen
I certainly witnessed bullying as a teen in both a small and a big school setting. I feel like it is a universal topic.,Darby Stanchfield,Teen

"I feel really honored to be part of The #seetherealme campaign. It's really amazing, as it helps many teen girls who are struggling. It helps them to find themselves and be true to who they are.",Jazz Jennings,Teen
"N.E.R.D. was also from - not too far from where I was from growing up. For a lot of people who make music, that was a huge influence in teen years.",Kali Uchis,Teen
"I'm really loving Billie Eilish's 'idontwannabeyouanymore.' Her dreamy vocals offer such a lovely moment of escape, and there's a sophistication to the lyrics that are so surprising coming from a teen artist.",Tan France,Teen
"When I was doing my research for 'Branded,' I'd meet groups of teenagers and preteenagers or tweens, and they would laugh at a magazine spread in a women's magazine or teen girl magazine and say, 'I'd never buy this outfit. I know these girls are starving themselves.' But they probably would go out and buy the thing eventually.",Alissa Quart,Teen

It's so easy as a teen to feel like everybody is having this normal experience - except you. You're on the outside.,Becky Albertalli,Teen
"I grew up in this household where reading was the most noble thing you could do. When I was a teenager, we would have family dinners where we all sat there reading. It wasn't because we didn't like each other. We just liked reading. The person who made my reading list until my late teen years was my mom.",Keith Gessen,Teen
"Weird Al was something that kids would listen to. It's funny, super funny, smart. It's just kind of jokey. I remember hearing 'Smells Like Nirvana' before hearing 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.' That's how it really worked. I think it's just such a cool thing how he introduced us to so many cool bands. Even Queen - 'Another One Rides the Bus.'",John Gourley,Teen
"It's important for Asian American kids to see themselves in stories and to feel seen. They need to know that their stories are universal, too, that they, too, can fall in love in a teen movie. They don't have to be the sidekick; they can be the hero.",Jenny Han,Teen
I still bump 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.' I used to listen to it before all my football games.,Freddie Gibbs,Teen
"I got a guitar when I was 14. I made really, really, really bad music as a teen. I learned to play Smashing Pumpkins and Hole songs.",Hunx,Teen
Teen boys are a huge mess.,Danielle Bregoli,Teen
"One of the things that defines YA is a really strong narrative. Adults love YA because, at the end of the day, they're good stories and page-turners. The other element is emotion. The teen years are a very emotional and intense time, and I think it's a time we that we can all relate to and remember.",Rebecca Serle,Teen
"I didn't know what it was going to look like or how anything was going to turn out, but the production on 'Teen Wolf' is so amazing. The way that they shoot it, edit it, and put it out there, it's really so exciting. I trust the team so much. They do such a good job.",Arden Cho,Teen

"Reading was my escape growing up in Ohio. Both of my parents lost their jobs when I was a teen, and it was hard. But I always had my books. Reading gave me a way of living different lives.",Anna Todd,Teen

"I was quite discerning the first year and when I was doing 'The Vampire Diaries' thing I was like, 'I'm really not sure if I want to do this; it's this whole teen thing, which I've done in England.'
