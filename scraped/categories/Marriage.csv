It's so important to keep a marriage alive with small treats and doing little things for each other. Just remembering to say nice things and to have listening time is vital. That ghastly phrase 'quality time' means taking three minutes to sit down and be still with someone rather than yelling over your shoulder as you rush out.,Joanna Lumley,Marriage
It is statistically proven that the strongest institution that guarantees procreation and continuity of the generations is marriage between one man and one woman. We don't want genocide. We don't want to destroy the sacred institution of marriage.,Alveda King,Marriage
"I often say that if you want to really want to understand the contract of marriage, just ask anyone who has been divorced. The marriage contract is one of property rights.

I prepare myself for rehearsals like I would for marriage.,Maria Callas,Marriage
"People often think of America as a classless society, but, of course, that isn't true.

"Republicans need to stay strong on the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those are values that are true to the party and true to who we are.

"I think there was a time in my life, probably in college, that I wished every guy was gay because it meant more women for me! I don't know what everyone's problem with it is. I wish everyone was gay! That's always the way I thought about it. I have no issue with it. If I have to suffer through marriage, why shouldn't they?","Donald Trump, Jr.",Marriage

"Like every girl, I had dreams of marriage, but I got victimized in a cheating scandal. When the proposal came through the family, everyone was happy.

"No matter how committed a marriage, there will always be other people - those we have chemistry with and those we don't, those we are attracted to, and those who shop for functional outdoors wear.

So I knew I could have a good life without that.",Rosamund Pike,Marriage
"Marriage is work. Get it out of your thick skull that marriage is, 'Oh, we got married and now we just live forever wonderfully.' It's work. It's just like starting a business: You're going to bicker with your business partner, but you don't leave the business partner. You work it out.",Jim Breuer,Marriage
"I tried to write about my first marriage in a fictional version but got two pages into it and realised it was too personal. Then I came up with an old-fashioned love triangle, which became the plot for 'Ralph's Party.'",Lisa Jewell,Marriage

"There's not a lot of room anymore for what I call 'made-up' drama. The drama comes from real places now - marriage takes work and focus, the kid stuff takes patience and commitment.

"It is my biggest regret that I let my marriage to Erica fail. It is what it is, and she is doing an incredible job with the kids, and we are in a great place.",James Packer,Marriage
"Marriage is a lot of things - a source of love, security, the joy of children, but it's also an interpersonal battlefield, and it's not hard to see why: Take two disparate people, toss them together in often-confined quarters, add the stresses of money and kids - now lather, rinse, repeat for the rest of your natural life.

"I'm a creative person. I love to write, I love to act, I love to perform, I love to create things with my hands, so I do all of these things that are kind of like hobbies in a way.

Marriage is hard.,La La Anthony,Marriage
"The 'Britishness' debate too often descends into worthy flannel about common values and mutual respect. To give a hard edge to what it means to be British, you have to say what is un-British, and, if necessary, legislate to stop anyone committing un-British acts. Forced marriage falls squarely into this category.",Damian Green,Marriage

"Someone asked me recently if marriage is 50-50 - it averages out to be 50-50, but sometimes it's 75-25, sometimes it's 90-10. In the end, it has to average out to be 50-50; that's how you support each other.",Linda McMahon,Marriage
