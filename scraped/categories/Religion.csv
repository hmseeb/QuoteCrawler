"Folk music usually has an emphasis on the lyrics and melody. And those lyrics are usually relevant in some way. And it's populist in scope, which is also true of Bad Religion.

"I think of religion as man's attempt to reach God, and you can't do that.",Anne Graham Lotz,Religion
"Corporate America limits the world to consumerism. Science can limit it to the material world. Even religion limits it to a lot of theories that can explain everything.

World War I and World War II were not fought because of religious reasons.",Kelsey Grammer,Religion
"It was the British who defined religion to divide and rule. That is what created the heat. That is what created the cut. Partition happened because of the rulers, fueled by a few powerful families on both sides who stood to gain. It is the politicians that keep everyone fighting.",Gulzar,Religion

"A universe with a God would look quite different from a universe without one. A physics, a biology where there is a God is bound to look different. So the most basic claims of religion are scientific. Religion is a scientific theory.",Richard Dawkins,Religion

Western conservatism is hawkish, hates government, and embraces individual freedom. Southern conservatism is populist, draws on evangelical Christianity, and plays upon racial resentments.",Jacob Weisberg,Religion
"We're so mixed up about religion in this culture. We say the Pledge of Allegiance, 'under God indivisible,' but there's no prayer in the schools. I would be so untethered without my personal faith. I wouldn't be able to go through a day - but that's my own experience.",Virginia Euwer Wolff,Religion

Yes, I want to be 'dangerous' to a dull and boring religion.",Mike Yaconelli,Religion
Religion can never reform mankind because religion is slavery.,Robert Green Ingersoll,Religion

"If religion comes into the public square, it is as vulnerable as any other human institution to be pelted with produce. Ignorance does not become wisdom just because you gussy it up with the Gospels.",Charlie Pierce,Religion

"Most religious people in America fully embrace science. So the argument that religion has some issue with science applies to a small fraction of those who declare that they are religious. They just happen to be a very vocal fraction, so you got the impression that there are more of them than there actually is.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Religion
"In Elizabethan England or classical Athens... theater was at the center of, not culture, but society and politics and religion and civic engagement. Those things have a different audience.",Diane Paulus,Religion

"Gandhi said it; Frederick Douglass said it. A lot of people have probably said 'It's not Christ that I have a problem with, it's his people.' And that was my struggle: it's God's people. I felt disenfranchisement. I felt so much abuse from organized religion because I'm walking in a direction that a lot of them couldn't fathom and can't understand.",Lecrae,Religion
"I'm looking for the best person irregardless of political party, of race or religion, or color of their skin. Those things don't matter to me.

"To an honest judge, the alleged marriage between religion and science is a shallow, empty, spin-doctored sham.",Richard Dawkins,Religion
"Every high school and college graduate in America should, I think, have some familiarity with statistics, economics and a foreign language such as Spanish.

They provide context.",Nicholas Kristof,Religion
The fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion.,Sushma Swaraj,Religion

"I have always marveled that so many religions exact such revenge against dissenters.

When you see it as a bridge, you aren't so worried about bringing others over to your side.",Keith Ellison,Religion
"Religion is a complex and often contradictory force in our world. It fosters hope and comfort but also doubt and guilt. It creates both community and exclusion. It brings societies together around shared belief and tears them apart through war. However, what unites the faithful, whatever their religion, is the unshakeable force of generosity.",Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen,Religion
"In the traditional urban novel, there is only survival or not. The suburban idea, the conformist idea, that agony can be seen to and cured by doctors or psychoanalysis or self-knowledge is nowhere to be found in the city.

"My four sons all knew I was a Jew, but they were allowed to be whatever they wanted to be.
