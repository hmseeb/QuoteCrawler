"Economics is not an exact science. It's a combination of an art and elements of science.

"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm - not all - that religion used to fill.",Bill Gates,Science
It is the function of science to discover the existence of a general reign of order in nature and to find the causes governing this order. And this refers in equal measure to the relations of man - social and political - and to the entire universe as a whole.,Dmitri Mendeleev,Science

"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths.",Karl Popper,Science
"Remember, science fiction's always been the kind of first level alert to think about things to come.

Every science fiction movie I have ever seen, any one that's worth its weight in celluloid, warns us about things that ultimately come true.",Steven Spielberg,Science

"Beauty is the lowest common denominator: I don't care what they say - every girl, every woman, wants to feel pretty and empowered and beautiful, within their own definition of beautiful. I love fashion, I love shopping, but I love beauty more because I love the science of it.",Eva Chen,Science
"Time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction, but Einstein's general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp space-time so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out.",Stephen Hawking,Science

"Boys do not evaluate a book. They divide books into categories. There are sexy books, war books, westerns, travel books, science fiction. A boy will accept anything from a section he knows rather than risk another sort. He has to have the label on the bottle to know it is the mixture as before.",William Golding,Science
"Science has been quite embattled. It's the most important thing there is. An arts graduate is not going to fix global warming. They may do other valuable things, but they are not going to fix the planet or cure cancer or get rid of malaria.",Bill Bryson,Science
"I have so many favourite science fiction films. I would say 'Alien' and 'Aliens' are two of my favourite sci-fi films. Also 'Children of Men' would be one of my favourite science fiction films.

"Arguably, my student status and perhaps my gender were also my downfall with respect to the Nobel Prize, which was awarded to Professor Antony Hewish and Professor Martin Ryle. At the time, science was still perceived as being carried out by distinguished men.",Jocelyn Bell Burnell,Science
"I actually started off majoring in computer science, but I knew right away I wasn't going to stay with it. It was because I had this one professor who was the loneliest, saddest man I've ever known. He was a programmer, and I knew that I didn't want to do whatever he did.",J. Cole,Science

"Ideas are 10 a penny. It's the execution that's the hard thing to do. House is standing up against a tide of sentiment and emotionalism over reason that threatens to engulf this world. When you think about it, a rationalist, a man of science and reason, is in a pretty lonely position.",Hugh Laurie,Science
"I feel like the thing we can do is celebrate people doing great work and create more cultural momentum and awareness that this is an important thing in the world.

Biology is the science. Evolution is the concept that makes biology unique.,Jared Diamond,Science

"Let's say intelligence is your ability to compose poetry, symphonies, do art, math and science. Chimps can't do any of that, yet we share 99 percent DNA. Everything that we are, that distinguishes us from chimps, emerges from that one-percent difference.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
"Neuroscience is a baby science, a mere century old, and our scientific understanding of the brain is nowhere near where we'd like it to be. We know more about the moons of Jupiter than what is inside of our skulls.",Matt Haig,Science
I don't think there's an interesting boundary between philosophy and science. Science is totally beholden to philosophy. There are philosophical assumptions in science and there's no way to get around that.,Sam Harris,Science
"I do not recognize the right of the public to break in the front door of a man's private life in order to satisfy the gaze of the curious... I do not think it right to dissect living men even for the advancement of science.

"Before a war military science seems a real science, like astronomy; but after a war it seems more like astrology.",Rebecca West,Science

Man lives for science as well as bread.,William James,Science
Science is but an image of the truth.,Francis Bacon,Science
"There's a snobbery at work in architecture. The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it's an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics.",Norman Foster,Science
"Many of us like to think of financial economics as a science, but complex events like the financial crisis suggest that this conceit may be more wishful thinking than reality.",Andrew Lo,Science

The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly - to develop strategies of seeing and showing.,Edward Tufte,Science

"Computer science inverts the normal. In normal science, you're given a world, and your job is to find out the rules. In computer science, you give the computer the rules, and it creates the world.",Alan Kay,Science
All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.,Leslie Fiedler,Science

"I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician because, as a second job, my mother would clean up a pediatrician's office. So I was like, 'Oh, OK, baby doctor.' Until I got to college, and all the courses of science with the blood, guts and cadavers? I was like, 'Mm, no.'",Angela Bassett,Science
"Science is the best idea humans have ever had. The more people who embrace that idea, the better.",Bill Nye,Science

Science without conscience is the death of the soul.,Francois Rabelais,Science

It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful: they are found because it was possible to find them.,J. Robert Oppenheimer,Science

Science does not just drive space travel - space travel also drives science.,Leroy Chiao,Science
"Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space.

"As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.",Noam Chomsky,Science
"The science of being healthy is well-known. It is not esoteric. There are no magic bullets. If you want to live a long life, we've known the answers for more than a hundred years. It's a wide-ranging diet with as much fruit and veg as you can stuff into yourself, and plenty of exercise. It doesn't even matter what kind of exercise.",Alice Roberts,Science
"I'm crazy about Grant: his character, his nature, his science in fighting and everything else. But I don't like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything, always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made, including blaming Prentiss for Shiloh.",Shelby Foote,Science

Science is basically an inoculation against charlatans.,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
The conflict between religion and science is inherent and (very nearly) zero-sum. The success of science often comes at the expense of religious dogma; the maintenance of religious dogma always comes at the expense of science.,Sam Harris,Science

"Marie Curie is my hero. Few people have accomplished something so rare - changing science. And as hard as that is, she had to do it against the tide of the culture at the time - the prejudice against her as a foreigner, because she was born in Poland and worked in France. And the prejudice against her as a woman.",Alan Alda,Science
"All the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers, so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quantities by operations with numbers.",James C. Maxwell,Science
"In 'Cosmicomics,' I came close to science fiction - I was inspired by cosmological subjects and the workings of the universe and invented a character who was a sort of witness to everything that was happening inside the solar system.",Italo Calvino,Science
"Feynman once said, 'Science is imagination in a straitjacket.' It is ironic that in the case of quantum mechanics, the people without the straitjackets are generally the nuts.",Lawrence M. Krauss,Science

"There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine.",Nikola Tesla,Science
Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence.,Louis Pasteur,Science
The Western day is indeed nearing when the inner science of self-control will be found as necessary as the outer conquest of nature.

The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.,Albert Einstein,Science
Science isn't just about solving this or that puzzle. It's about understanding how the world works: the whole world from the vastness of the cosmos to the particularity of an individual human life. It's worth thinking about how all the different ways we have to talk about the world manage to fit together.,Sean M. Carroll,Science

"Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians.

"History is, in its essentials, the science of change. It knows and it teaches that it is impossible to find two events that are ever exactly alike, because the conditions from which they spring are never identical.",Marc Bloch,Science
I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students.,Carl Sagan,Science
"'Star Trek' is the McDonald's of science fiction; it's fast food storytelling. Every problem is like every other problem. They all get solved in an hour. Nobody ever gets hurt, and nobody needs to care. You give up an hour of your time, and you don't really have to get involved. It's all plastic.",David Gerrold,Science
"Innovations in science and technology are the engines of the 21st-century economy; if you care about the wealth and health of your nation tomorrow, then you'd better rethink how you allocate taxes to fund science. The federal budget needs to recognize this.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
"Politicians should read science fiction, not westerns and detective stories.",Arthur C. Clarke,Science
"We must accept what science tells us, that man was born from the earth.

I consider myself a nerd. I love science and technology.,Alexis Ren,Science
"Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate.

"Art is elemental. Reason alone as it's expressed in the sciences can't be man's complete answer to reality, and it can't express everything that man can, wants to, and has to express. I think God built this into man. Art along with science is the highest gift God has given him.",Pope Benedict XVI,Science
"I am a little too absorbed by science to be able to philosophise much; but the more I look into myself, the more I find myself possessed by the conviction that it is only the science of Christ running through all things, that is to say true mystical science, that really matters. I let myself get caught up in the game when I geologise.",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,Science

In science the important thing is to modify and change one's ideas as science advances.,Herbert Spencer,Science
"All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult.

"Part of what it is to be scientifically-literate, it's not simply, 'Do you know what DNA is? Or what the Big Bang is?' That's an aspect of science literacy. The biggest part of it is do you know how to think about information that's presented in front of you.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science

Science should always be in the business of attempting to disprove itself.,Ben Stein,Science
"Goethe died in 1832. As you know, Goethe was very active in science. In fact, he did some very good scientific work in plant morphology and mineralogy.

And I desperately needed books that would take me out of my environment and show me a world where being smart and brave and prepared was more important than being cute or cheerful or knowing the right thing to say. And that's what science fiction and fantasy gave me.,Leigh Bardugo,Science
"Even when I was studying mathematics, physics, and computer science, it always seemed that the problem of consciousness was about the most interesting problem out there for science to come to grips with.",David Chalmers,Science
"Art and religion first; then philosophy; lastly science. That is the order of the great subjects of life, that's their order of importance.",Muriel Spark,Science
"A science is something which is constructed from truth on workable axioms. There are 55 axioms in scientology which are very demonstrably true, and on these can be constructed a great deal.",L. Ron Hubbard,Science
"Rather than relying on farmers, ranchers, outdoorsmen, lumberjacks, surveyors, oil workers, miners, or community leaders who have decades of land use experience, government policymakers turn to 25-year-olds with master's degrees in ecology and political science to run the country's public lands policy.",Lauren Boebert,Science
Science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of Nagasaki. The shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved.,Jacob Bronowski,Science
Modern science is predicated on 'truths' verified through accurate observation and measurements of physical world phenomena.,Bruce Lipton,Science
"I loved science, and when I discovered Buddhist meditative practices and martial arts, I was able to bridge those ways of knowing the world into my own unique way. From that grew the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, which became my karmic assignment.",Jon Kabat-Zinn,Science

We are living in a science fiction world.,George Takei,Science
"Corporate America limits the world to consumerism. Science can limit it to the material world. Even religion limits it to a lot of theories that can explain everything. I think we need cinema to break that apart and remind us that we're not in control, and we don't understand as much as we think do.",Scott Derrickson,Science
"To me it's no accident that all the symphony orchestras around the world tune up to the note A. And A is 440 cycles, except in Germany where it's 444. But the universe is 450 cycles. So what I'm trying to say is, I think it's God's voice, melody especially. Counterpoint, retrograde inversion, harmony... that's the science and the craft.",Quincy Jones,Science
The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it.,Carl Friedrich Gauss,Science

I'm not a very big fan of science fiction. I think that I'm a very big fan of living in the physical world.,Pranav Mistry,Science
There is no science in this world like physics. Nothing comes close to the precision with which physics enables you to understand the world around you. It's the laws of physics that allow us to say exactly what time the sun is going to rise. What time the eclipse is going to begin. What time the eclipse is going to end.,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
You need to use data science and machine learning to get the ground truth of what's happening inside of a company.,Chamath Palihapitiya,Science
Public sharing is an important part of science.,Richard Dawkins,Science
Freedom is the oxygen without which science cannot breathe.,David Sarnoff,Science
"Science has sometimes been said to be opposed to faith, and inconsistent with it. But all science, in fact, rests on a basis of faith, for it assumes the permanence and uniformity of natural laws - a thing which can never be demonstrated.",Tryon Edwards,Science

"As a practicing neurologist, I place central importance in applying current science to the notion of disease prevention.",David Perlmutter,Science
"Of course, the American education system is very inefficient in many ways compared to other countries in Europe or Japan, but it works in such a way that at least the few people who are going onto unusual careers and science can manage to get into that, even though they go through an earlier stage that doesn't give them much.","John Forbes Nash, Jr.",Science
"The 'science' in 'science fiction' isn't just physics and engineering. It can also be linguistics, anthropology, and psychology.",Ann Leckie,Science

It is characteristic of science that the full explanations are often seized in their essence by the percipient scientist long in advance of any possible proof.,John Desmond Bernal,Science
"I was an aspiring astrophysicist, and that's how I defined myself, not by my skin color. People didn't treat me as someone with science ambitions. They treated me as someone they thought was going to mug them, or who was a shoplifter.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
"I think both running and science reflect certain character traits. I have endurance, patience, and ambition. I'm willing to work hard toward a goal, to push myself and overcome limits. Running and science both let me express these traits.",Wolfgang Ketterle,Science

A lot of what the 'Culture' is about is a reaction to all the science fiction I was reading in my very early teens.,Iain Banks,Science
"Now that sports science is more advanced, we know that there are so many off-pitch factors that can affect how good you can become. If people are telling you to sleep a certain number of hours, eat specific foods, and drink a certain volume of fluids, then you have to be prepared to listen and learn.",Gareth Bale,Science
"I wrote 'Science For Her!' because I found normal, manly science textbooks to be too intense for my small size-0 brain, and I found normal science textbooks to have covers too heavy for my dainty size-0/size-2-with-bloat hands.",Megan Amram,Science

Manufacturing doesn't just mean building cars and metal-bashing; it includes making pharmaceuticals and hi-tech electronics. A crucial part of the process is the research and development that allows better and greener products to come to market. Britain has traditionally had a strong science and engineering base.,Martin Rees,Science
"Science is based on the possibility of objectivity, on the possibility of different people checking out for themselves the observations made by others. Without that possibility, there is no empirical principle capable of deciding between different arguments and theories.",Jose Padilha,Science
"If the history of resistance to Darwinian thinking is a good measure, we can expect that long into the future, long after every triumph of human thought has been matched or surpassed by 'mere machines,' there will still be thinkers who insist that the human mind works in mysterious ways that no science can comprehend.",Daniel Dennett,Science
"I read comics and I did science, and never really put them together until I accidentally found myself in the middle of one.",Randall Munroe,Science
"Science is not about control. It is about cultivating a perpetual condition of wonder in the face of something that forever grows one step richer and subtler than our latest theory about it. It is about reverence, not mastery.",Richard Powers,Science
"When I was a kid, I loved 'The Curse of Frankenstein,' 'The Creeping Unknown,' 'X: The Unknown.' I love 'Forbidden Planet,' 'The Thing from Another World.' They were science fiction/horror movies, generally.",John Carpenter,Science

"I am a pastor, and I teach and preach the Bible to my congregation every week. But the Bible is not a manufacturer's handbook. Neither is it a science textbook nor a guidebook for public policy.",Adam Hamilton,Science
"The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river; and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.",John Dalberg-Acton,Science
"Blade Runner appears regularly, two or three times a year in various shapes and forms of science fiction. It set the pace for what is essentially urban science fiction, urban future and it's why I've never re-visited that area because I feel I've done it.",Ridley Scott,Science
"If I had my choice, every high school would be teaching financial literacy along with math and science.",Gregory Meeks,Science
It seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide.,Friedrich August von Hayek,Science
"Globalisation means many other countries are asserting themselves and trying to take over leadership. Please don't ask Americans to let others assume the leadership of human exploration. We can do wonderful science on the Moon, and wonderful commercial things. Then we can pack up and move on to Mars.",Buzz Aldrin,Science
"The last thing you ever want to do is extend the period of frailty and disability and make people unhealthy for a longer time period.

I actually started my career in planetary science with a master's thesis on Pluto.,Alan Stern,Science
"You can't train kids in a world where adults have no concept of what science literacy is. The adults are gonna squash the creativity that would manifest itself, because they're clueless about what it and why it matters. But science can always benefit from the more brains there are that are thinking about it - but that's true for any field.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
"Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.",James Buchan,Science
Any neuroscience book is the death of me. I'm currently obsessed with 'The Moral Landscape' from Sam Harris. He's a controversial writer addressing science and religion while talking about the deep undertaking of your brain.,Eiza Gonzalez,Science
"If you keep telling girls they're less good at science, that will probably be self-fulfilling. But there are quite a lot of women who are good at it.",Lisa Randall,Science
One of the things that science fiction gets to do is thought experiments about the human condition that would be impractical or unethical to conduct in real life.,Robert J. Sawyer,Science
"I am fascinated by the engineering. The science of constructing and understanding why it stands. And I am drawn by the madness, the beauty, the theatricality, the poetry and soul of the wire. And you cannot be a wire-walker without mingling those two ways of seeing life.",Philippe Petit,Science
"There's been an incredible censorship in America and throughout the world, but particularly in America where students aren't even allowed to critically think about evolution, the issue of origins; they are not allowed to hear other points of view; they are taught incorrectly about science and taught that evolution is fact.",Ken Ham,Science
"To an honest judge, the alleged marriage between religion and science is a shallow, empty, spin-doctored sham.",Richard Dawkins,Science
"There does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science. There are science and the applications of science, bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it.",Louis Pasteur,Science
"People, and especially theologians, should try to familiarize themselves with scientific ideas. Of course, science is technical in many respects, but there are some very good books that try to set out some of the conceptual structure of science.",John Polkinghorne,Science
"In science, each new result, sometimes quite surprising, heralds a step forward and allows one to discard some hypotheses, even though one or two of these might have been highly favored.",Stanley B. Prusiner,Science
The thing about science fiction is that it's totally wide open. But it's wide open in a conditional way.,Octavia E. Butler,Science
"I love science fiction, and one of the things I love about it is that it's so very different. You can read stuff that's just fast-paced adventure, and the characters are cardboard, but who cares, because they're heroes, and we love it. And you can read stuff that's really deep character, and everything in between.",Ann Leckie,Science
"Science fiction fans are awesome - they love you so much that they'll watch anything you do, even if it's complete crap. I never dreamed that I would go to conventions and sit down and have coffee with a Klingon. It's so weird, but it's my life.",Katee Sackhoff,Science
"I loved everything. I loved sciences and I loved humanities. But ultimately, I felt that in the humanities, you know, you're writing about things that already exist. But in the sciences, you're discovering things that no one has known before. Ultimately I chose psychology because it seemed to combine science with things that I liked to think about.",Carol S. Dweck,Science
Whilst I'm all for psychedelic science - I think it's fantastic - I don't think we necessarily have time to wait for the science to tell us these medicines are useful. The indigenous cultures have already shown us the ways.,Gail Bradbrook,Science
"In the United States, one of the main topics of academic political science is the study of attitudes and policy and their correlation. The study of attitudes is reasonably easy in the United States: heavily-polled society, pretty serious and accurate polls, and policy you can see, and you can compare them.",Noam Chomsky,Science
I was a political science major in college because that's where my head was.,Jeffrey Wright,Science

"I wrote the very first stories in science fiction which dealt with homosexuality, The World Well Lost and Affair With a Green Monkey.",Theodore Sturgeon,Science
"Darwin gives courage to the rest of science that we shall end up understanding literally everything, springing from almost nothing - a thought extremely hard to comprehend and believe.",Richard Dawkins,Science
"You can believe what you want religiously. Religion is one thing, but science, provable science, is something else.",Bill Nye,Science
The birth of science as we know it arguably began with Isaac Newton's formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion. It is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20th-century with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.,Paul Davies,Science
"Follow your curiosity, and have the courage to meet the challenge. That's where science starts, in my opinion.",Tasuku Honjo,Science
"I'm a geophysicist and all my earth science books when I was a student, I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.",Robert Ballard,Science
"I'm not a science fiction writer, I'm a physicist.",Michio Kaku,Science
The wealthy are always surrounded by hangers-on; science and art are as well.,Anton Chekhov,Science
"Science isn't about authority or white coats; it's about following a method. That method is built on core principles: precision and transparency; being clear about your methods; being honest about your results; and drawing a clear line between the results, on the one hand, and your judgment calls about how those results support a hypothesis.",Ben Goldacre,Science
"Though neglectful of their responsibility to protect science, scientists are increasingly aware of their responsibility to society.",John Polanyi,Science
Space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time.,Doris Lessing,Science

"All writers are going to have to learn more about science, because it's such an interesting part of their environment.",Kurt Vonnegut,Science
"Most religious people in America fully embrace science. So the argument that religion has some issue with science applies to a small fraction of those who declare that they are religious. They just happen to be a very vocal fraction, so you got the impression that there are more of them than there actually is.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,Science
"Science - or the products of science like technology - is just a way of achieving something real, something that happens, something that works.",Richard Dawkins,Science
"Well, logos is science or reason, something that helps us to function practically and effectively in the world, and it must therefore be closely in tune and reflect accurately the realities of the world around us.",Karen Armstrong,Science
"I think a lot of people are frightened of technology and frightened of change, and the way to deal with something you're frightened of is to make fun of it. That's why science fiction fans are dismissed as geeks and nerds.",Iain Banks,Science
"To me, mathematics, computer science, and the arts are insanely related. They're all creative expressions.",Sebastian Thrun,Science
"Empty heads, cognitive science has taught us, learn nothing. The powerful cultural and personal flexibility of our species is owed at least in part to our starting off so well-informed; we are good learners because we know what to pay attention to and what questions are the right ones to ask.",Paul Bloom,Science
"I enjoy science, and I'm a very curious person. I always want to know the reason behind everything, big or small.",Malala Yousafzai,Science
"Science fiction has always been a means for political comment. H.G. Wells' 'The War of the Worlds' wasn't about a Martian invasion - it was a critique of British colonialism, and... 'The Time Machine' is really an indictment of the British class system.",Robert J. Sawyer,Science
"Tracing the beginnings of the interwoven stories of science can be arbitrary, as beginnings are so often lost in the mists of time.",Elizabeth Blackburn,Science
"Science fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science, because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.",Philip K. Dick,Science
The beauty of science is to imagine more than we can prove. And string theory gives you a radically different interpretation of the universe.,Ashoke Sen,Science
"The history is important because science is a discipline deeply immersed in history. In other words, every time you perform an experiment in science or in medicine, what you're actually doing is you're answering someone, answering a question raised by someone in the past.",Siddhartha Mukherjee,Science
Education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach: skepticism.,David Suzuki,Science
Science is a cemetery of dead ideas.,Miguel de Unamuno,Science
I fell in love with the science at Merck.,Kenneth Frazier,Science
Historical science is being left in the dust.,Jack Horner,Science
I think it's science and physics are just starting to learn from all these experiments. These experiments have been carried out hundreds and hundreds of times in all sorts of ways that no physicist really questions the end point. I think that these experiments are very clearly telling us that consciousness is limitless and the ultimate reality.,Robert Lanza,Science
"It's very important for us to see that science is done by people, not just brains but whole human beings, and sometimes at great cost.",Alan Alda,Science
"It is a curious thing: man, the centre and creator of all science, is the only object which our science has not yet succeeded in including in a homogeneous representation of the universe. We know the history of his bones, but no ordered place has yet been found in nature for his reflective intelligence.",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,Science
"Although the theory of relativity makes the greatest of demands on the ability for abstract thought, still it fulfills the traditional requirements of science insofar as it permits a division of the world into subject and object (observer and observed) and, hence, a clear formulation of the law of causality.",Werner Heisenberg,Science
In 1968 when I was in high school I built a four-foot-tall remote control robot with pneumatic cylinders that operated his hands. My robot won first place at a science competition at the University of Alabama where my high school was the only African-American school represented. That was a huge moral victory.,Lonnie Johnson,Science
It is sometimes important for science to know how to forget the things she is surest of.,Jean Rostand,Science
Until politics are a branch of science we shall do well to regard political and social reforms as experiments rather than short-cuts to the millennium.,John B. S. Haldane,Science
"The art world is a very prissy little thing over in the corner, while the major cultural forces are being determined by techno science.",Natalie Jeremijenko,Science
"Why don't we have enough teachers of math and science in the public schools? One answer is well, if they knew the subject well, they'd also know enough to work for Google or Goldman Sachs or God knows where.",James Harris Simons,Science
"Especially in the world today, where science rightfully is so important in terms of technology, innovation, telecom, Internet, fighting diseases, I think it's equally important that poetry and painting have their share of support.",Leon Black,Science
"Science is, rightly, searching for drugs to arrest ageing or to slow the advance of dementia. But the evidence suggests that many of the most powerful factors determining how you age come from what you do, and what you do with others: whether you work, whether you play music, whether you have regular visitors.",Geoff Mulgan,Science
"I've always loved science, as far back as I can remember. I was very, very curious about how everything worked: the world, the physical universe, chemistry, law. So it was only natural to be curious about how our mind works.",Leonard Mlodinow,Science

"We have long possessed the art of war and the science of war, which have been evolved in the minutest detail.",Fredrik Bajer,Science
"I was diagnosed dyslexic, but I should point out I don't think it majorly impacted on me. I don't feel that I overcame great odds. If anything it just pushed me in a certain direction that wasn't academia or maths or science.",Tom Burke,Science
"I am tired of all this sort of thing called science here... We have spent millions in that sort of thing for the last few years, and it is time it should be stopped.",Simon Cameron,Science
"I did get a very fine education, and not just in science. It took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that I really should take an interest in humanities.",Joshua Lederberg,Science
"Traditional academic science describes human beings as highly developed animals and biological thinking machines. We appear to be Newtonian objects made of atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, and organs.",Stanislav Grof,Science
"We often say that our science is objective and accurate, but we don't often say that our science is incomplete - that although the established parts of natural science are very well tested and the evidence makes a compelling case for things being as they've been described, there nevertheless are open questions that we cannot answer.",Jim Peebles,Science
"In World War II, a British mathematician named Alan Turing led the effort to crack the Nazis' communication code. He mastered the complex German enciphering machine, helping to save the world, and his work laid the basis for modern computer science. Does it matter that Turing was gay?",Alan K. Simpson,Science

"The science is settled; it's not even a consensus, it is a unanimity that human life begins at conception.",Marco Rubio,Science

There is no significant man-made Global Warming underway and the science on which the computer projections of weather chaos are based is badly flawed.,John Coleman,Science
"Truth is of no practical value to mankind save as it affects terrestrial phenomena, hence the discoveries of science should be concealed or glossed over wherever they conflict with orthodoxy.",H. P. Lovecraft,Science
"This much we know: Journalism is not a precise science. It's, on its best day, is a crude art. We make mistakes; I make mistakes. With more than 50 years as a journalist, I have at least had the opportunity to blow more stories, make more mistakes than maybe anybody in television.",Dan Rather,Science
"I'm not looking ahead joyfully to the rest of my life or the future of the human race. I've always written about man as an animal species among other animals, competing for limited resources. Our population is exploding. Our environment is dying. Science has debunked God.",T. C. Boyle,Science
"When my kids were growing up, I wanted their teachers to teach them science, reading, math and history. I also wanted them to care about my kids. But I did not want my children's public school teachers teaching them religion. That was my job as a parent and the job of our church, Sunday school, and youth group.",Adam Hamilton,Science

Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.,Alan Perlis,Science
Representation is so important because it's hard for kids to want to be what they can't see. Little girls and boys need to know that it's natural for girls to love science and tech.,Emily Calandrelli,Science

"Picking apart a story for its scientific underpinnings doesn't diminish it, it enhances it, makes us dream of the possibilities it proposes. I think appreciating the magic of reality, going from 'can't happen' to 'could happen,' is the fundamental appeal of science fiction.",Kyle Hill,Science
"I have passed English medical examinations in Hong Kong... In my youth, I experienced overseas studies. The languages of the West, its literature, its political science, its customs, its mathematics, its geography, its physics and chemistry - all these I have had the chance to study.",Sun Yat-sen,Science
We all have faith in something: usually a mixture of some personal beliefs with modern science. I am not like that. Mostly I just believe in what personally has worked for me.,James Altucher,Science
"I've made money by just trying to do world-class science. That's the goal that we're setting at Celera. If we do world-class science and create new medicine paradigms, the money will more than follow at a corporate level and at a personal level.",Craig Venter,Science
Science fiction was never my thing. I have no interest in it. So I don't think I could successfully pull off being on a project like that without really losing my mind.,Denis Leary,Science
"Quantum mechanics broke the mold of the previous framework, classical mechanics, by establishing that the predictions of science are necessarily probabilistic.",Brian Greene,Science
"I've had the chance to work with Christopher Plummer, one of the great stage and film actors, a couple of times, including on 'Prototype,' the first TV movie I ever did. It was science fiction in the Ray Bradbury sense, written by the famous team who created Columbo, Levinson, and Link.",David Morse,Science
"Our greatest theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking, recently declared that humans have no more than a hundred years to get off this planet to ensure the survival of our species. And when someone such as he does so, it is with an understanding not just of the science, but of both our tenuous place and our possibility in the universe.",Rick Tumlinson,Science
"The harsh truth is that Trump is a living co-morbidity, he's over 70, out of shape, eats terribly and doesn't believe in science. In other words, his chances of dying of COVID-19 despite the best medical team in the country being at his side are still higher than the average person.",Jason Johnson,Science
"The views of the Earth are really beautiful. If you've ever seen a space IMAX movie, that's really what it looks like. I wish I'd had more time just to sit and look out the window with a map, but our science program kept us very busy in the lab most of the time.",David M. Brown,Science
We have to keep up the fight for evidence-based science and policy.,Piers Corbyn,Science
"I grew up a Red Sox fan. I grew up going to Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts and the Science Museum and Symphony Hall and going to the Common, walking around. My whole family at different times lived and worked in Boston.",James Spader,Science
"Many of the mainstream agricultural scientists, especially at the agricultural schools, but at all of our major universities, are tied into all sorts of contractual relationships and consulting relationships with the life science companies.",Jeremy Rifkin,Science
We should not be a party that is opposed to science.,Matt Gaetz,Science
I think one of the great historical contributions of science is to weaken the hold of religion. That's a good thing.,Steven Weinberg,Science
"I'm frustrated with Hollywood and television and the movies because they see science fiction as an excuse for eye candy, for lots of great special effects.",David Gerrold,Science
There is an idea that a mind is wasted on the arts unless it makes you good in math or science. There is some evidence that the arts might help you in math and science.,Wynton Marsalis,Science
"The thing that interests me least about the radio business is the radio business. But I've had to learn a little bit about it. It's not rocket science: You get ratings, that's good.",Al Franken,Science
"This is a global fight to get the right people in the right place and we're talking about people with PhDs in engineering, computer science, mathematics.",Jerry Moran,Science
It should be mandatory that you understand computer science.,will.i.am,Science
"I went to Drexel University, majored in computer science. Drexel has a great program - they call it co-op - but its, like, mandatory to graduate to do internships. I loved it because it helped me figure out very quickly that I didn't really want to be a programmer.",John Gruber,Science
