"From politics to parenting, Christians have something to say.",Monica Johnson,Parenting
My approach to parenting is the same as my approach to life: it's all about putting in the hours and working hard.,Perez Hilton,Parenting

"As a mother living in poverty, I don't expect my parenting choices to be respected by default.",Stephanie Land,Parenting
"Parenting is love, sure, but it's as much about receiving love as it is giving it. Parenthood is a kind of vanity.",Rumaan Alam,Parenting
"No work-family balance will ever fully take hold if the social conditions that might make it possible - men who are willing to share parenting and housework, communities that value work in the home as highly as work on the job, and policymakers and elected officials who are prepared to demand family-friendly reforms - remain out of reach.",Arlie Russell Hochschild,Parenting
"We're living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me, I just followed my parents around on their errands; when they were busy on the phone, I was quiet. It's a different kettle of fish these days: They run the house, and you listen to their music, and you go to their appointments.",Edie Falco,Parenting
I love to read books that focus on parenting topics because there are so many different ways to do things. I find these books offer a lot of great opinions on many different subjects.,Kourtney Kardashian,Parenting
"Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory. Even with today's scattershot patterns of marriage and parenting, a family is collectivist to a more than North Korean degree.",P. J. O'Rourke,Parenting
"Society should see parenting as a public health issue and help parents to bring their children up feeling loved. We have birthing classes, but no parenting classes. The latter is desperately needed if we are to avoid self-destruction.",Bernie Siegel,Parenting

"Most moms and dads, they want to be good moms and dads. But it's an incredibly hard job when you are stressed out, when you are poor, when your life is in chaos.

I set out to write an anti-parenting parenting book.,Bruce Feiler,Parenting

"Whatever needed to be done, I need to know how to do it just as well as my wife. You know, for us to be able to really balance the parenting. It was very humbling, and it was also, um - terrifying.

I'm worried about parents who aren't parenting.,Barbara Bush,Parenting

"One of the many problems with parenting is that kids keep changing. Just when you're used to one stage, they zoom into another.",Pamela Druckerman,Parenting
"How my parents are in the kitchen is a good indicator of their parenting style. Mum cooks for sustenance, wants to get in and out, the job done quickly. My Dad wants to prance around in the kitchen, create a curry - and a mess - and entertain everyone.",Nadiya Hussain,Parenting
"I don't want to believe it - that parenting itself makes art hard, that you must always sacrifice one for the other, that there is something inherently selfish and greedy and darkly obsessive in the desire to care as much about the thing you are writing or making as you do about the other humans in your life. What parent would want to believe this?",Kim Brooks,Parenting
"Parenting is the hardest thing I have ever done. I tried to find the balance between the strict, traditional Chinese way I was raised, which I think can be too harsh, and what I see as a tendency in the West to be too permissive and indulgent. If I could do it all again, I would, with some adjustments.",Amy Chua,Parenting

"My parents have always had this philosophy that overindulging your children is one of the worst things you could do as a parent. It's something that was hammered into my head growing up.

Solo parenting is harder than Premier football. It's mentally tough.,Wayne Bridge,Parenting
"Parenting advice is mostly useless because every family is uniquely its own; artistic advice is mostly useless because every artist works in their own way. Thus, figuring out how to balance the two has an intense specificity.",Rumaan Alam,Parenting
"Ah, the power of two. There's nothing quite like it. Especially when it comes to paying utility bills, parenting, cooking elaborate meals, purchasing a grown-up bed, jumping rope and lifting heavy machinery. The world favours pairs.

So much of my work is about children and/or parenting; it's something I'm drawn to without being able to completely articulate why.,Paul G. Tremblay,Parenting
"Launching a kid into college is about more than having the money to pay for it. Parents invest so much of their time and identities in the process that it can feel like a part time job. For many parents, the college your child ends up attending becomes a parenting grade.",Rachel Simmons,Parenting

Marriage is no longer the main way in which societies regulate sexuality and parenting or organize the division of labor between men and women.,Stephanie Coontz,Parenting

I listen to parenting books on tape.,Hilaria Baldwin,Parenting
"Deciding together to have a child and sharing in child-rearing do not immunize a marriage. Indeed, collaborative couples can face other problems. They often embark on such an intense style of parenting that they end up paying less attention to each other.",Stephanie Coontz,Parenting
"My father was the biggest influence on my own parenting because I became the complete opposite to him. He found it very difficult to show physical love, like cuddling and that kind of stuff, so I went the other way.",Keith Allen,Parenting

I ask only child-free pals for parenting advice because they're the only ones sane and well-rested enough to have any real insight.,Glennon Doyle Melton,Parenting
"For me, conscious parenting is staying attuned to your child, being really open and in the moment. It means staying as present as possible in your own breath for the betterment of your whole family.",Anna Getty,Parenting
"There's nothing to be gained, and much to be lost, in trying to bend every child to match a one-size-fits-all notion of what it means to be a boy or girl of a specific age. Better to set a few parameters and then go with the flow. Call it 'jazz parenting.'",Ezekiel Emanuel,Parenting

"We put more emphasis on who can drive a car than on who can be a parent. And I think there ought to be mandatory parenting classes starting in high school, and you should have to have a license to be able to be a parent to explain that you don't give alcohol to kids.",Dale Archer,Parenting
"In the past, I have been guilty of returning from work with some parenting words of wisdom, ignoring the fact that my wife has been dealing with the situation for a while. The correct strategy at these times is to wind my mansplaining neck in.",Romesh Ranganathan,Parenting
People always want to give you advice about parenting. People who you've never met before will tell you you're doing something wrong. And it's quite similar in writing. People forget that you're a human; they just want to give you their advice.,Emma Healey,Parenting
"Most people who have grown up introverted in this very extroverted culture of ours have had painful experiences of feeling like they are out of step with what's expected of them. Parenting can pose unique challenges for introverted parents, who fear that their own painful experiences will be repeated in their children's lives.",Susan Cain,Parenting
"Somebody once told me I treated my smart phone like Wilson, the volleyball Tom Hanks turns into a friend when he's stranded on a desert island in that movie 'Castaway.' It's an apt comparison: parenting a toddler occasionally feels like being marooned, and your phone is your only connection to the rest of the world.",Rachel Simmons,Parenting
"Parenting girls makes you quite gender-conscious - it's almost impossible to fight the power of pink. It's not such a terrible thing to want to be a princess when you're five, but it would be nice if there were some other options.",Robert Webb,Parenting
"Parenting put music in the right place for me. Touring was always the first priority before, but it isn't any more. And, paradoxically, that has made my ability to make music much easier.",Anoushka Shankar,Parenting
"The secret to success, to parenting, to life, is to not count up the cost. Don't focus on all the steps it will take. Don't stare into the abyss at the giant leap it will take. That view will keep you from taking the next small step.",Regina Brett,Parenting

"Tiger parenting is all about raising independent, creative, courageous kids. In America today, there's a dangerous tendency to romanticize creativity in a way that may undermine it.",Amy Chua,Parenting

"Your skills may not be anything out of the ordinary, but you can do miraculous things with what you've got. Maybe it's your parenting skills, or your compassion. It may be your curiosity, your imagination or unique style of fashion. Even if it seems to be no big deal, the lesson here is we all have unique abilities and talents.",Chris Gardner,Parenting
"Some men don't want to be responsible fathers. It's easier to say 'Let's just turn the kids over to the state.' Women end up bearing the entire load, raising kids alone without a husband to share the parenting.",Tim Huelskamp,Parenting
"I do not think there was anything abusive in my house. Yet, I stand by a lot of my critiques of Western parenting. I think there's a lot of questions about how you instill true self-esteem.",Amy Chua,Parenting
"The parenting books didn't work for me; I got my parenting lessons from everything but the books! And it was about figuring things out. So every time I had a thought, I would put down my conclusions and thoughts.",Sonali Bendre,Parenting
"Kids are soft these days, period, end of the story in every respect. People coddle them too much. I'm sick of that; it's irresponsible parenting. Taking care of them is one thing, but turning little boys into little girls because you're coddling them so much, kids need to have experiences on their own.",Bill Goldberg,Parenting
"I have a neuroscience background - that's what my doctorate is in - and I was trained to study hormones of attachment, so I definitely feel my parenting is informed by that.",Mayim Bialik,Parenting

"No matter how calmly you try to referee, parenting will eventually produce bizarre behavior, and I'm not talking about the kids. Their behavior is always normal.",Bill Cosby,Parenting
"My childhood should have taught me lessons for my own fatherhood, but it didn't because parenting can only be learned by people who have no children.",Bill Cosby,Parenting
Parents are key when it comes to keeping kids off drugs. Good parenting is the best anti-drug we have.,Mel Carnahan,Parenting

I'm torn about late parenting. I believe people should spend their twenties living and having fun and not having any regrets later. I also think people in their thirties generally make better parents but so many of my friends are having trouble - myself included - as fathers get older.,Eric McCormack,Parenting
"I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.",Debra Winger,Parenting
"In truth, I am a single mother. But I don't feel alone at all in parenting my daughter. Krishna has a whole other side of her family who loves her, too. And so Krishna is parented by me, but also by her grandmother and aunts and cousins and uncles and friends.",Padma Lakshmi,Parenting
"No, I've never wanted kids. But I do read about parenting a lot.",Fiona Apple,Parenting

"Of course, the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age.",Jennifer Aniston,Parenting

Relationships are complicated no matter what style of parenting you choose.,Mayim Bialik,Parenting
"My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale, New York, society woman, best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book 'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford's wire hangers look like pool noodles.",Sloane Crosley,Parenting
"For decades, parents were told by so-called parenting 'experts' that offspring would be best raised on the belief each is special and entitled to all life has to offer.",Bob Barr,Parenting
"In response to our fast-food culture, a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood, a move toward slow parenting could be growing. With vital government supports for state-of-the-art public child care and paid parental leave, maybe we would be ready to try slow love and marriage.",Arlie Russell Hochschild,Parenting
"As a dad, you are the Vice President of the executive branch of parenting. It doesn't matter what your personality is like, you will always be Al Gore to your wife's Bill Clinton. She feels the pain and you are the annoying nerd telling them to turn off the lights.",Jim Gaffigan,Parenting
"I come from a dysfunctional family, so my views of parents and parenting used to be highly mixed.",Tamora Pierce,Parenting

Parenting isn't just parenting your own child.,Lewis Black,Parenting

"I'm not the first to admit that raising a child in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can bear an embarrassing resemblance to the TV show 'Portlandia.' My wife and I try to have some ironic distance from the culture of organic, chemical-free parenting, but we're often participants.",Adam Davidson,Parenting

The science can tell you that the thousands of pseudo-scientific parenting books out there - not to mention the 'Baby Einstein' DVDs and the flash cards and the brain-boosting toys - won't do a thing to make your baby smarter. That's largely because babies are already as smart as they can be; smarter than we are in some ways.,Alison Gopnik,Parenting
"My parenting style is probably like that of my parents, because you do how you learn. My mother was very nurturing and loving, but very stern. She was a disciplinary. My dad was also very loving.",Kym Whitley,Parenting

"I think a generation ago, dads went to work, they came home, and they had their dinner, had a drink, and then went to bed.

My guess is that good and bad parenting is spread fairly evenly across different social groups. But can you imagine Tony Blair lecturing the middle class on how to bring up their children? He is far more comfortable as a latter-day exponent of the Poor Law mentality.,Martin Jacques,Parenting
"In my experience (I am the lone father of an eight-year-old boy who lost his mother when he was one year old), parenting is the most difficult of all jobs: forget your chief executives, editors, prime ministers and the like - parenting is far more challenging.",Martin Jacques,Parenting
"Single parenting is sometimes just a case of sitting around by yourself in mild despair, not knowing what to do.",Simon Van Booy,Parenting
Slow parents understand that childrearing should not be a cross between a competitive sport and product-development. It is not a project; it's a journey. Slow parenting is about giving kids lots of love and attention with no conditions attached.,Carl Honore,Parenting

"You can make sure your kids make their beds and hang up their clothes and put their dishes in the dishwasher when you're the one calling the shots. So, parenting alone, for me anyway, I think is almost easier, being single.",Jane Kaczmarek,Parenting
I think parenting these days is definitely different from when a lot of people grew up. As much blame as we give a lot of our kids for what they're not doing... I also try to give them as much credit for dealing with things that we didn't have to deal with. Bullying was one on one and face to face. Now it's all over the Internet.,Nelly,Parenting
I think parenting is very different now. We're totally governed by our children!,Andy Serkis,Parenting
