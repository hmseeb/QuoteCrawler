Architecture is a result of a process of asking questions and testing them and re-interrogating and changing in a repetitive way.,Thom Mayne,Architecture
"Zaha Hadid's Maxxi Museum is proof that Rome and contemporary architecture are no longer a paradox. The building is characteristic Hadid - with curving lines and organic shapes - and the permanent collection already boasts works by Francesco Clemente, William Kentridge, and Gerhard Richter.",Amanda Hearst,Architecture
"The spirituality of the music is something that I always search for in what I do, because I think that music has to have everything inside: a strong architecture, a support, the emotion.",Ludovico Einaudi,Architecture
"After about the first Millennium, Italy was the cradle of Romanesque architecture, which spread throughout Europe, much of it extending the structural daring with minimal visual elaboration.",Harry Seidler,Architecture
"We need to rediscover the essence of the meaning of 'the use.' Architecture is, above all, here for a better living. Every gesture, every shape must be justified by various reasons that would reinforce their reason to be, their use, and will give more sense to their beauty.",Christian de Portzamparc,Architecture
"It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms.",Oscar Niemeyer,Architecture
"In architecture you should live for 150 years, because you have to learn in the first 75 years.",Renzo Piano,Architecture

"If architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect's task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting.",Arne Jacobsen,Architecture
"I need quite a lot going on, so a perfect holiday for me is one in a cooler climate with wonderful scenery, animals or great architecture.",Deborah Meaden,Architecture
Many of the received models of modern architecture and planning owe their ultimate origin to the building code and public health reform movements of the second half of the 19th century.,Kenneth Frampton,Architecture
"I loved logic, math, computer programming. I loved systems and logic approaches. And so I just figured architecture is this perfect combination.",Maya Lin,Architecture
"I work a little bit like a sculptor. When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It's not about paper, it's not about forms. It's about space and material.",Peter Zumthor,Architecture
"If architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports.",Michael Mandelbaum,Architecture

Escape from the architecture ghetto is one of the major drivers and has been from the very beginning.,Rem Koolhaas,Architecture
"I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.",Michael Graves,Architecture
"Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.",Ernest Hemingway,Architecture

"Like in great painting and architecture, in couture, to make clothes you must eliminate, eliminate, eliminate to obtain the true sense of a line. You see, the more you add, the more you load on, the more it's mad. You must try to have just the silhouette, which is an intelligence in clothes.",Hubert de Givenchy,Architecture

"The problem with digital architecture is that an algorithm can produce endless variations, so an architect has many choices.",Peter Eisenman,Architecture
"Architecture is always the will of the age conceived as space - nothing else.

"Architecture has curled up in a ball and it's about itself. It has found itself either as a freakshow, where you're not sure if it's good or bad but at least it's interesting, or at the behest of forces of commerce.",David Chipperfield,Architecture
One of the dilemmas of architecture in general is that there is a Catch-22 - you can't actually get to be commissioned to do certain types of building until you've already built that type of building. So it seems to be incredibly hard to get going.,Bjarke Ingels,Architecture
Today's developer is a poor substitute for the committed entrepreneur of the last century for whom the work of architecture represented a chance to celebrate the worth of his enterprise.,Arthur Erickson,Architecture
"Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle.",Oscar Niemeyer,Architecture
"It seems a fantastic paradox, but it is nevertheless a most important truth, that no architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect.",John Ruskin,Architecture
Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.,Frank Lloyd Wright,Architecture

"In Zagreb, the Old Town really could be Prague. You go two hours to the coast to Opatija, and you really could be in the South of France, in the Croatian Riviera. And then you head down the coast towards Split, and you get into more Turkish architecture, so you can double Istanbul.",James Watkins,Architecture
"Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul.",Louis Kahn,Architecture
Clothing has been called intimate architecture. We want to go beyond that.,Issey Miyake,Architecture
Architecture is politics.,Mitch Kapor,Architecture

Architecture is a art when one consciously or unconsciously creates aesthetic emotion in the atmosphere and when this environment produces well being.,Luis Barragan,Architecture
"All architecture, classical or not, must have some sense of order, and order is much harder to achieve without the straight lines and right angles that have dominated the building art from time immemorial.",Martin Filler,Architecture

I have no requirements for a style of architecture.,Michael Graves,Architecture

The very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in architecture.,Alvar Aalto,Architecture
"Architecture produces a musical mood in our inner being, and we notice that even though the elements of architecture and music appear to be so alien in the outer world, through this musical mood engendered in us, our experience of architecture brings about a reconciliation, a balance between these two elements.",Rudolf Steiner,Architecture
"Concrete you can mold, you can press it into - after all, you haven't any straight lines in your body. Why should we have straight lines in our architecture? You'd be surprised when you go into a room that has no straight line - how marvelous it is that you can feel the walls talking back to you, as it were.",Philip Johnson,Architecture
"I am an engineer, not just an architect, so I've always been motivated by technique or technology. As soon as technology moves just a little bit, it changes architecture.",Santiago Calatrava,Architecture
"I would like to attend college in the future when I have time. I have always been interested in architecture, so perhaps I would pursue a degree in that or business.",James Maslow,Architecture
"Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art.",Thom Mayne,Architecture
"The intellectual force of the West is still dominant, but other cultures are getting stronger. I expect that we will develop a new way of thinking in architecture and urban planning, and that less will be based on our models.",Rem Koolhaas,Architecture
"Wherever technology reaches its real fulfillment, it transcends into architecture.",Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Architecture
"I came to architecture from building. Because my father was a builder, everybody was - and is - a builder in my family.",Renzo Piano,Architecture
"A world of few choices, whether in jeans or mates, is a world in which individual differences become sources of alienation, unhappiness, even self-loathing. If no jeans fit, you'll feel uncomfortable or inferior. If no housing developments reflect your taste for unique architecture, you'll write screeds against philistine mass culture.",Virginia Postrel,Architecture
Does an architecture to assuage the spirit have a place?,Arthur Erickson,Architecture
"Inherent in architecture, it involves everything in life so that there is absolutely no end to it. By the time you're seventy or eighty, you're still beginning. So, that's the kind of life I've preferred to being the expert at forty and dead, you know.",John Lautner,Architecture
"In L.A., cinema and television might be seen as more interesting places for architecture than ever before.",Neil Denari,Architecture
"Few developments central to the history of art have been so misrepresented or misunderstood as the brief, brave, glorious, doomed life of the Bauhaus - the epochally influential German art, architecture, crafts, and design school that was founded in Goethe's sleepy hometown of Weimar in 1919.",Martin Filler,Architecture
"Once you learn to look at architecture not merely as an art more or less well or more or less badly done, but as a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant.",Louis Sullivan,Architecture
I always look forward to the next project. That is one of the wonderful things about architecture - you always can hope for another project to design.,Cesar Pelli,Architecture
"When people are deprived of a sense, their other senses get heightened. If you're culturally devoid of something - of weather, of artistry, of interesting architecture, all the way down the line to culture itself - you're either forced to give in and get that car dealership, or you manufacture those things for yourself.",Tim Burton,Architecture
I think about architecture all the time. That's the problem. But I've always been like that. I dream it sometimes.,Zaha Hadid,Architecture
"Liquid architecture. It's like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it's a way of - for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city.",Frank Gehry,Architecture
Japanese architecture is traditionally based on wooden structures that need renovating on a regular basis.,Tadao Ando,Architecture

"I visited Notre Dame at 11 in the morning and the sun was entering through the south rose window, it was so impressive. This is when architecture can be king and give people sensations, like music.",Santiago Calatrava,Architecture
"New Orleans is unlike any city in America. Its cultural diversity is woven into the food, the music, the architecture - even the local superstitions. It's a sensory experience on all levels and there's a story lurking around every corner.",Ruta Sepetys,Architecture
"Architecture is undistinguished, sometimes derelict, but occasionally, as in 'Post and Beam,' there is something arresting in a setting... the building behind the Cathedral.",Edith Pearlman,Architecture
I don't believe that classical architecture is enough to engage people anymore. They say: 'So what else is new?',Peter Eisenman,Architecture
"I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character.",Maya Lin,Architecture
"Architecture depends on its time. It is the crystallization of its inner structure, the slow unfolding of its form.",Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Architecture
There's nothing Dutch about my architecture.,Rem Koolhaas,Architecture
"The secret to the movie business, or any business, is to get a good education in a subject besides film - whether it's history, psychology, economics, or architecture - so you have something to make a movie about. All the skill in the world isn't going to help you unless you have something to say.",George Lucas,Architecture
"Boston is home to the world's most innovative thinkers - in science and technology, and in business, art, and architecture.",Marty Walsh,Architecture

"Britain loves a bargain, but you don't get good, lasting architecture on the cheap.",David Chipperfield,Architecture

"I do believe architecture, and all art, should be content-driven. It should have something to say beyond the sensational.",Charles Jencks,Architecture
"Chicago is known for good steaks, expensive stores and beautiful architecture. Unfortunately, the Windy City also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics, violent crime, and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country.",Bob Barr,Architecture
"Architecture is a special kind of career that showcases the accumulations of culture, time, and history.",Ma Yansong,Architecture
Japanese traditional architecture is created based on these conditions. This is the reason you have a very high degree of connection between the outside and inside in architecture.,Tadao Ando,Architecture
"By 1970, the first stirrings of the revolt against Modernist orthodoxy in architecture had been felt, although it would be several years more until Postmodernism was widely accepted and made classical motifs permissible in high-style building design for the first time in decades.",Martin Filler,Architecture
"The architecture for 'Paladin' - given that it's at least three books, with the possibility of more - turned out to be bigger than anything I've ever created, with multiple levels of reality, interlocking mysteries and a terabyte of time frame.",Mark Frost,Architecture
"There is something about giving everything to your profession. In Italian, an obsession is not necessarily negative. It's the art of putting all your energy into one thing; it's the art of transforming even what you eat for lunch into architecture.",Renzo Piano,Architecture
"To come to England in the 1970s was to return to this strange other-world of half-known history. I found the imperial architecture curiously familiar: the post office, the town hall, the botanic gardens.",Romesh Gunesekera,Architecture
"Architecture is art, nothing else.",Philip Johnson,Architecture
"Architecture is a service business. An architect is given a program, budget, place, and schedule. Sometimes the end product rises to art - or at least people call it that.",Frank Gehry,Architecture
"The English light is so very subtle, so very soft and misty, that the architecture responded with great delicacy of detail.",Stephen Gardiner,Architecture
"Good architecture should be a projection of life itself, and that implies an intimate knowledge of biological, social, technical, and artistic problems.",Walter Gropius,Architecture
"I've always thought that design can have equal importance to the idea of internal architecture. Professionally, things can be very dogmatic - you do the architecture, someone else does the interiors, someone else does the furniture, the fabric, etc. But I think design is all-encompassing.",Zaha Hadid,Architecture
"I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron's invitation to collaborate on the design, and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end, I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture.",Ai Weiwei,Architecture
"Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of Western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process.",Kenneth Clark,Architecture
"The common thread for everything I do is this idea of a Web-services architecture. What does that mean? It means taking components of software and systems and having them be self-describing, so that you can aim them, ask them what their capabilities are, and communicate with them using a standard protocol.",Bill Gates,Architecture
Architecture doesn't come from theory. You don't think your way through a building.,Arthur Erickson,Architecture
"The body moves through space every day, and in architecture in cities that can be orchestrated. Not in a dictatorial fashion, but in a way of creating options, open-ended sort of personal itineraries within a building. And I see that as akin to cinematography or choreography, where episodic movement, episodic moments, occur in dance and film.",Antoine Predock,Architecture
"Dubai is a vibrant city: Big cars, big buildings... it reminds me of my home town, Hong Kong. People are always on the move here, and there's a lot going on. There are some wonderful architecture and some not-so-wonderful.",John Rocha,Architecture

The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams.,Jay Chiat,Architecture
"It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture. That which I have insisted upon as the life of the whole, that spirit which is given only by the hand and eye of the workman, can never be recalled.",John Ruskin,Architecture
"Architecture to me is whole. I cannot say I only care about this 25% and the other 75% I let go... it's just I want to work the way I want to work. In my shop, you can order certain things and other things you cannot. They are not available.",Peter Zumthor,Architecture
Architecture struck me between the eye and the eyeball.,Louis Kahn,Architecture
"One my favorite things is to go to the provinces of Russia and see the 18th century wood churches with the onion dome architecture. These humble wonders of incredible imagination of architects that were obviously not living in places like Paris or London, but they've created these amazing churches.",Andre Leon Talley,Architecture

"Chicago is a city built on architecture, and there are plenty of buildings to scale.",Andrew Shaffer,Architecture
"Any architectural project we do takes at least four or five years, so increasingly there is a discrepancy between the acceleration of culture and the continuing slowness of architecture.",Rem Koolhaas,Architecture

"I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.",Maya Lin,Architecture
"I wanted to be a cartoonist, but there was no cartoon academy. So I enrolled in the Royal Danish Art Academy School of Architecture. But then I really got smitten by architecture.",Bjarke Ingels,Architecture
There are a lot of questions about whether architecture is art. The people who ask that think pretty tract houses are architecture. But that doesn't hold up.,Frank Gehry,Architecture
Architecture is by definition a very collaborative process.,Joshua Prince-Ramus,Architecture
"The problem of architecture has always been the same throughout time. Its authentic quality is reached through its proportions, and the proportions cost nothing. In fact, most of them are proportions among things, not the things themselves. Art is almost always a question of proportions.",Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Architecture
"Half of architecture students are women, and you see respected, established female architects all the time.",Zaha Hadid,Architecture
"Architecture is exposed to life. If its body is sensitive enough, it can assume a quality that bears witness to past life.",Peter Zumthor,Architecture
"'Station to Station' came out of a sense of urgency - a sense that culture, be it art, film or architecture, has become so compartmentalised. For this project, we wanted to break that and create a language that is more nomadic and less materialistic and really empowering for the creators and the audience.",Doug Aitken,Architecture
"Forms in nature are a byproduct of a reciprocal action between a given material and the conditions of the environment. But in architecture, the process is the direct opposite: First you decide on the form, and then you think how to build it in reality.",Neri Oxman,Architecture
You must understand the difference between being an architect and a politician. Architecture is a profession of perseverance. You have to come through. The politician is there to blame someone.,Santiago Calatrava,Architecture
"The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it's magical.",Maya Lin,Architecture
I think architecture is rarely the product of a single ideology. It's more like it can be shaped by a really big idea. It can accommodate a lot of life forms.,Bjarke Ingels,Architecture
"Every market we go to, we have a domain-specific language. Every domain-specific language, underneath, has an architecture.",Jensen Huang,Architecture
"I didn't even have a clear idea of why I wanted to go to Oxford - apart from the fact I had fallen in love with the architecture.

I have a huge love for architecture.,Alison Sudol,Architecture
"All those involved in the construction of an architectural design, from the architect to the builder, have an attachment to the architecture, although it's difficult to quantify the attachment.",Tadao Ando,Architecture

"Just as it takes time for a speck of fish spawn to develop into a fully grown fish, so, too, we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes in the world of ideas. Architecture demands more of this time than other creative work.",Alvar Aalto,Architecture
"In art or architecture your project is only done when you say it's done. If you want to rip it apart at the eleventh hour and start all over again, you never finish. I was one of those crazy creatures.",Maya Lin,Architecture
"My assumption was that all indigenous architecture would be more fractal. My reasoning was that all indigenous architecture tends to be organized from the bottom up. As it turns out, though, my reasoning was wrong.",Ron Eglash,Architecture
London is one of the most civilised places in the world for the procedure of making architecture and urban design.,Renzo Piano,Architecture
"If you look at the Earth without architecture, it's sometimes a little bit unpleasant. So there is this basic human need to do shelter in the broadest sense of the word, whether it's a movie theater or a simple log cabin in the mountains. This is the core of architecture: To provide a space for human beings.",Peter Zumthor,Architecture
"Architecture has a strong link with the movies in terms of time progression, sequencing, framing, all of that.",Christian de Portzamparc,Architecture

"Architecture depends on facts, but its real field of activity lies in the realm of the significance.",Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,Architecture
Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.,Alvar Aalto,Architecture
"I paint mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work.",Bob Dylan,Architecture
"Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan and, in my opinion, the best place to visit. It is an amazing hub of history. It's called the Pink City because all the architecture has a hint of pink in the stones used. It's an amazing stop for all kinds of food but also for history and shopping. It has a little bit of everything.",Maneet Chauhan,Architecture
"Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, and the site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.",Sarah Parcak,Architecture

The imperial vastness of late Roman architecture was made possible by the invention of concrete.,Iain McGilchrist,Architecture
"I used to think that the great thing about sculpture was that, like Stonehenge, it was something that stood against time in an adamantine way, and was an absolute mass in space. Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place.",Antony Gormley,Architecture

"If I was influenced by anything, it was architecture: structure having to do with logic. If you don't do it right, the whole thing is going to cave in. In a certain sense, you can carry that to graphic design. Fortunately, however, nobody is going to die if you do it wrong.",Paul Rand,Architecture

"To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.",I. M. Pei,Architecture

Do I provoke as a method of investigation? Of course. That's the essence of architecture. Do I do it with gusto? I do.,Thom Mayne,Architecture
"With vocal and choral music, first and foremost, it's the text. Not only do I need to serve the text, but the text - when I'm doing it right - acts as the perfect 'blueprint', and all the architecture is there. The poet has done the heavy lifting, so my job is to find the soul of the poem and then somehow translate that into music.",Eric Whitacre,Architecture

"Chroniclers of the role of paper in history are given to extravagant pronouncements: Architecture would not have been possible without paper. Without paper, there would have been no Renaissance. If there had been no paper, the Industrial Revolution would not have been possible. None of these statements is true.",Mark Kurlansky,Architecture

And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.

A building that has great environmental responsibility is a political animal in a way because it becomes promotional of a cause. I think that kind of advocacy through architecture is really good.,Antoine Predock,Architecture
"If you have an architecture of control, let's say, where you select in advance everything that's going to affect your life, then you're going to live in a very small world that will have an echo chamber feature... Pandora, which I love, actually feeds into that.",Cass Sunstein,Architecture
"The 'International Style of Modernism' came with the advent of building services.

"I've always been interested in an architecture of resistance - architecture that has some power over the way we live.

"Grenfell, the building set on fire with the help of its own face, is a scene of a complex injustice: one that is moral, economic, political, and aesthetic. Not only was the cladding unsafe, it was ugly; not only was it ugly, it was untrue both to the architecture of the building it covered and untrue to its responsibility to human safety.",Hisham Matar,Architecture
"The thing I love about Rome is that is has so many layers. In it, you can follow anything that interests you: town planning, architecture, churches or culture.

"I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture. In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.",Janet Echelman,Architecture
"In northern architecture - the cathedrals of Europe and all the little churches - the details, the carving of stone, become necessary because the light is not there to help you very much. You have to enrich surfaces. The desert reduces form to its simplest nature. There is no need for gargoyles or flying buttresses in the desert.",I. M. Pei,Architecture
"Of course I know very little about architecture, and the older I get the less I know.",Richard Rogers,Architecture
"All of these technologies that we are putting together... our memory technology, our CPU, our graphics architecture, our GPUs - all that is being applied to where the data is. You can almost predict where Intel will be in the future. It will be where data resides.",Brian Krzanich,Architecture

"I was given this beautiful coffee table book of Soviet architecture for my birthday. It has a lot of holiday camps, swimming pools, theatres, and buildings that were built for leisure activities.

"The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person; and in the end they unite.",Havelock Ellis,Architecture
"I got into architecture via fine arts, and I was a sculptor myself, and I have always involved artists in my projects. When I say 'involved,' I mean I always bring artists in at the beginning projects before they're built and say, 'Will you do a room? Will you do a sculpture floating in mid-air? Will you make a chimney? Will you do something?'",Peter Marino,Architecture
"Everything about camera movement, about how film was made, shot architecture, and time management... I was horrible at all that.",Jeff Perry,Architecture
I was always really geeky about design and buildings. Always into architecture as a kid.,Aldis Hodge,Architecture

"You might say that when you step inside, you're entering a honorific space, but that's something totally different than experiencing it. And in architecture the experience comes first. That has the deepest effect on us.",Thom Mayne,Architecture
"As a general rule, when a new industry takes root, and the first products emerge in a wave, almost always the architecture of the product will be proprietary and interdependent in character.",Clayton M. Christensen,Architecture
"Think about what happens when architecture becomes ruins. All you have left are some little columns on a cliff, but it's still such an overwhelming experience that you could say architecture is that which makes ruins beautiful.",Santiago Calatrava,Architecture
"It was nice to finish up Stanford. I think I always felt that I would be there for four years and graduate, and definitely didn't want to leave early. A degree was definitely a plus, and I was having a lot of fun in school. But after football, you know, I don't know. I really did enjoy studying architecture; it was a blast.",Andrew Luck,Architecture
"Little do we find any Phoenician architecture or plastic art at all comparable even to those of Italy, to say nothing of the lands where art was native.",Theodor Mommsen,Architecture
"My apartment reflects my views as an architect. It is minimal, austere. The architecture doesn't impose itself upon you. The apartment is a stage for other things to take place.",Bernard Tschumi,Architecture
"I was planning to go into architecture. But when I arrived, architecture was filled up. Acting was right next to it, so I signed up for acting instead.",Gilbert K. Chesterton,Architecture
Perhaps because my town was so naturally gothic in its architecture and relative isolation - the roads often closed in winter - my stories tended toward the ghostly and the creepily suspenseful right from the get-go.,Andrew Pyper,Architecture
"I like to be surrounded by books. My wife Evelyn has a Ph.D. in comparative literature, so we have a lot of her Spanish and German literature books which are wasted on me, plus a lot of novels and books on art and architecture shared by us both. Evelyn used to edit an art magazine called 'FMR,' so we have a common interest in design.",David Chipperfield,Architecture

"Everything man is doing in architecture is to try to go against nature. Of course we have to understand nature to know how far we have to go against nature. The secret, I think, of the future is not doing too much. All architects have the tendency to do too much.",Frei Otto,Architecture
"The British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture, and the language that we use about politics, it's completely unsustainable. You either decide to be part of that transition to do something different. Or you cling to old certainties.",Nick Clegg,Architecture

I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.,Helmut Jahn,Architecture

"The truth be told, the World Trade Center was neither a very good work of architecture nor a very successful piece of urbanism. Its shortcomings were somewhat mitigated by the westward and southward expansion of the World Financial Center and Battery Park City during the 1980s.",Martin Filler,Architecture
"When I was in architecture school, I became curious about the exact mathematics, physics, and construction of the great structures I had been studying. I wanted to know how these amazing things would work: the Pantheon, the dome of Michelangelo, the dome of Brunelleschi. So I decided to study civil engineering.",Santiago Calatrava,Architecture
"Somehow, architecture alters the way we think about the world and the way we behave. Any serious architecture, as a litmus test, has to be that.",Thom Mayne,Architecture
"You need a prince to make a town in an intellectual sense. Developers want to make money. If they cared about architecture, they'd become architects. I've had so many projects that never came off because they had no sponsor, and not because they were utopian. I just want to build a town that's normal.",Leon Krier,Architecture
"You can never draw enough or read enough - reading about architecture, in other words.",Michael Graves,Architecture

"When I was 18, I lived in Greenwich Village, New York, for nine months. At that time, I wanted to change the world, not through architecture, but through painting.

"When I was studying architecture in the 1970s, it was intellectually bankrupt.",Elizabeth Diller,Architecture
I don't think architecture is radical. How can something that takes years and costs millions be radical?,David Chipperfield,Architecture

"I fought violently for the autonomy of architecture. It's a very passive, weak profession where people deliver a service. You want a blue door, you get a blue door. You want it to look neo-Spanish, you get neo-Spanish. Architecture with any authenticity represents resistance. Resistance is a good thing.",Thom Mayne,Architecture
"If you examine this, I think that you will find that it's the mechanics of Japanese architecture that have been thought of as the direct influence upon our architecture.",Minoru Yamasaki,Architecture

The logic of Palladian architecture presented an aesthetic formula which could be applied universally.,Stephen Gardiner,Architecture
"Music, first of all, is completely about abstraction, which is exactly what architecture is not. In a way, it has been incredibly constructive to know what true abstraction is. So you don't fall into the trap of thinking that what you do is abstract.",Rafael Vinoly,Architecture
"I see only one requirement you have to have to be a director or any kind of artist: rhythm. Rhythm, for me, is everything. Without rhythm, there's no music. Without rhythm, there's no cinema. Without rhythm, there's no architecture.",Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu,Architecture
"Downtown Toronto is a very good place to talk about the neutrality of modernist architecture. I'm sure this kind of box-building was interesting in the Twenties, Thirties and Forties, but I think it's absolutely ridiculous to build like this in 2013.",Stefan Sagmeister,Architecture

We work with the Mexican authorities. We have our own intelligence architecture. And we are aware of the involvement of smuggling organizations in irregular migration and the misinformation that they disseminate to vulnerable populations.,Alejandro Mayorkas,Architecture
"What makes architecture extraordinary is that you're looking at the building, but your peripheral vision is also seeing how it fits within a space. And it's seeing more than one part of the building at one time.",Sydney Pollack,Architecture
"There is a lot of interest in the arts, music, theatre, filmmaking, engineering, architecture and software design. I think we have now transitioned the modern-day version of the entrepreneur into the creative economy.",John Baldacci,Architecture
"If people want to see Beaux-Arts, it's fine with me. I'm interested in good architecture as anybody else.",Louis Kahn,Architecture
"When you go to a normal architecture firm they aren't going to be innovative in terms of their systems. They're not going to be thinking of the whole lifespan of this project, or how do we document every single light bulb, or every product, so that when a chair breaks in a conference room, we can replace it right away.",Miguel McKelvey,Architecture
"The aesthetic of architecture has to be rooted in a broader idea about human activities like walking, relaxing and communicating. Architecture thinks about how these activities can be given added value.",Thom Mayne,Architecture
"When I started designing in school, I discovered that I had a knack for it. I fell completely in love with architecture, and I remain in love with it.",Cesar Pelli,Architecture
"Italy is full of historical buildings. And Europe holds a great history of philosophy from Greece until today. I read all those books and see these buildings, and I think of where I stand when I design my architecture.",Tadao Ando,Architecture
I went into architecture a little as 'Peck's Bad Boy.' It allowed me to be a critic in a socially condoned way.,James Polshek,Architecture

"While doing my architecture from the Parsons School of Design, I also did theatre.",Kalyani Priyadarshan,Architecture

"The thing people forget is that the entire world - or, at least, Europe, U.S., transatlantic, Russia, Soviet Union - that security architecture has been in place since 1945 and has been refined.

"If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.",Arne Jacobsen,Architecture
"I studied architecture in New York. So, really I was very moved, like everyone else, to try to contribute something that has that resonance and profundity of it means to all of us.",Daniel Libeskind,Architecture
"I don't think architecture should be considered as an art form in the first instance. Whenever I say that, it makes people really angry. But this is a very political profession in the Grecian sense. I believe there have to be reasons for every building, and that the ideas should not be self-referential.",James Polshek,Architecture
What is being called the UN 'gender architecture' is more like a shack. Women need a bigger global house if equality is ever to become a reality.,Charlotte Bunch,Architecture
"Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space, architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses.",Elizabeth Diller,Architecture
"I always point out to my Passover guests that the Hebrews were not living in isolation. They were at the crossroads of several great, elaborate cultures with their own mythology and religion and art and architecture and cultural belief.

"Prince Charles was a lot wittier than I thought he'd be, and passionate about the environment and architecture.",Kris Marshall,Architecture
People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.,Marc Newson,Architecture
Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.,Arthur Erickson,Architecture
"I was in school for architecture and when you're in school for a creative discipline, so much of what you produce comes out of inspiration from other people. The more you're exposed to architecturally, the better you can develop your own language out of that history of architectural thought.",Evan Sharp,Architecture
"In a way, architecture is about communication. That's an aspect of the discipline that is somewhat lacking, and there's definitely room for more progression into that area. I suppose that gives me a bit of a different edge. I'm also very, very used to doing a lot of exhaustive research and finding interesting information from different sources.",Magnus Larsson,Architecture
"When I started studying architecture, people would say, you know, 'Can you tell me why are all modern buildings so boring?' Because, like, people had this idea that in the good old days, architecture had, like, ornament and little towers and spires and gargoyles, and today, it just becomes very practical.",Bjarke Ingels,Architecture
"I got a degree in architecture for the educational experience but in terms of career, everything is cinema.",Kalyani Priyadarshan,Architecture
"In a place like the Greek Theater in L.A., to try and create a close connection with the audience seems almost antithetical to the architecture of the building.",Alex Ebert,Architecture
"To me... San Francisco is an ideal city, intellectually stimulating and naturally beautiful. The oceans and forests are close enough to refresh the spirit; the architecture is always exciting.",Ruth Bernhard,Architecture
I think the chance of finding beauty is higher if you don't work on it directly. Beauty in architecture is driven by practicality. This is what you learn from studying the old townscapes of the Swiss farmers.,Peter Zumthor,Architecture
The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.,Arthur Erickson,Architecture
"The beauty of architecture is it involves work that stretches over a very long time but often starts in one instant, with just one emotion, a kind of instinctual response.",Ma Yansong,Architecture

"I don't see that any buildings should be excluded from the term architecture, as long as they are done properly.",Arne Jacobsen,Architecture

Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies.,Malcolm Wallop,Architecture
"Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.",Larry Wall,Architecture

"You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.",Walter Russell Mead,Architecture
"That Moorish architecture is all over the place, of course. It affects me everywhere I see it, as it does so many people. But Brand Library was a special place to me, and I know I've paid homage to it many times in my drawings.",Jim Woodring,Architecture
I'd like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.,Caroline Wozniacki,Architecture
"In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction, I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture, and things that cost money. I wanted to not swing a hammer, and make money... and not do stuff that was dirty. I attempted to get into comedy. I started to do stand-up, but I wasn't very good at it.",Adam Carolla,Architecture

I don't know why I've always been so captivated by architecture.,Tim Gunn,Architecture
"Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it's changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan.

I've never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced.,Oren Peli,Architecture
I would've been intrigued by being a film director. I would've been intrigued by politics. I thought about architecture.,Charlie Rose,Architecture
"By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art. The Sloane domestic aesthetic - symmetry, class symbolism and brown furniture - became as unfashionable as it had been hot in the early Eighties.",Peter York,Architecture
"About 1998, when 'Wide World of Sports' and the 'Footy Show' came to an end for me, I couldn't type. When I started architecture, it was a very aesthetic, creative, an almost art process, where lettering and thick line were how you expressed yourself on the paper.",Max Walker,Architecture
"I love Sutton House in Clapton, a beautiful example of Tudor architecture.",Sharon Horgan,Architecture
"My university degree is in art and, yes, I do a lot of drawing for all my books.

Princeton University's campus environment presents unique challenges and opportunities for architecture to act as a social condenser.,Steven Holl,Architecture
"I'd been to Stourhead and was inspired by the perfect parity between architecture and art; in fact, the architecture is the art. I wrote a piece called 'Not Sculpture Park,' because most of these things become car parks for bought-in sculpture. The artists should be working with the site, not just plonking pieces down.",Charles Jencks,Architecture
"Modernist architecture and town planning is inimical to human beings... based on the Darwinian concept that evolution is open ended, that there must always be something new and better.",Leon Krier,Architecture

"Truly great architecture always transcends its stated function, sometimes in unanticipated ways.",Martin Filler,Architecture
"Cost overruns are not uncommon in architecture, particularly for designs that depart from structural or technological norms, or demand a finer quality of execution than commercial schemes - conditions typical of buildings for cultural institutions.

Architecture was the last of the major professions to devise a formal 'cursus honorum' before its practice could be undertaken.,Martin Filler,Architecture
"The tall building, concentrating man in one place more densely than ever before, similarly concentrates the dilemma of our public architecture at the end of the twentieth century: whether the new forms made possible by technology are doomed by the low calculations of modern patrons and their architects.",Martin Filler,Architecture
"I always wanted to be an actor, but I always loved design, and growing up in New Orleans there was such great style, great architecture. I would decorate my little apartment in New York over and over again, because it only had a couple of rooms. And I did it for friends and family on the side just for fun.",Bryan Batt,Architecture
"The thing about Chicago is that it really isn't like any other place. The architecture and the layout of the city are the best. I'm from the Midwest, and consider myself a Midwesterner.

Try to make a poem that has some of those qualities.",Robert Pinsky,Architecture
"Prediction is structurally inseparable from the business of punditry: It creates the essential image of indefatigable authority that is punditry's very architecture; it flows from that calcified image, and it provides the substance for the story that keeps getting told about the inevitability of American progress.",Rick Perlstein,Architecture
