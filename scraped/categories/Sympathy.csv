So once you understand the patterns that shape a person, how can you not find sympathy?",Forest Whitaker,Sympathy

"Here's my rule: You always want to pay cash for your own books, because if they look at the name on the credit card and then they look at the name on the book jacket, then there's this look of such profound sympathy for you that you had to resort to this. It really is withering.",Carl Hiaasen,Sympathy
You can't run a business based on sympathies; otherwise our business would be hampered.,Marc Rich,Sympathy

"As a mentor, you have to be willing to put yourself in your mentee's shoes to understand their struggles that they deal with. It's not supposed to turn into a pity party by any means, but empathy speaks volumes to a mentee in need of help rather than forced sympathy.",Tobias Harris,Sympathy
"Kindliness and sympathy, fellowship and understanding, are always good, but best when they come from a distant corner of the world.",Archibald Hill,Sympathy

Having a baby is a disaster for your career. I don't think there's any sympathy.,Mariella Frostrup,Sympathy
"As far as I'm concerned, I own my dogs as I own my body. My legs are with me when I take a shower, and I feel no shame. If I were to lose one, I'd grieve, and people would send sympathy cards, but it would be my condition that evoked the sympathy, not the fate of the leg. That's like losing a dog.",Elizabeth Marshall Thomas,Sympathy
"As a Scot, I instinctively feel a sympathy towards a culture which is based on generosity. It's very refreshing.

There are times when a sports figure doesn't deserve sympathy.,Stephen Rodrick,Sympathy

"What is the meaning of 'gossip?' Doesn't it originate with sympathy, an interest in one's neighbor, degenerating into idle curiosity and love of tattling?

I always received much more satisfaction as a defense attorney in obtaining an acquittal for a client than I ever have as a D.A. in obtaining a conviction. All my interests and sympathies tend to be on the side of the individual as opposed to the state.,Jim Garrison,Sympathy
"You can't have empathy for somebody that's gone through something you haven't - because, definitionally, you can't. But you can feel for them and have sympathy for them.

"I have every sympathy for writers. It's a mystery to me what they do. I can edit. I can cross out and say, 'I'm not saying that' or, 'How about we move this to here? Wouldn't that make that bit of the story better?' But where any of it comes from is beyond me. I will never write a play or a novel.",Alan Rickman,Sympathy

My sympathies have always been for working-class people.,Christa McAuliffe,Sympathy
I'm a champion for personal differences. I have no sympathy for drug companies that can't figure out how to make personalized medicine. We could generalize that to 'All society should be much more personalized.',George M. Church,Sympathy

"We need to broaden our sympathies both in space and time - and perceive ourselves as part of a long heritage, and stewards for an immense future.",Martin Rees,Sympathy
"I think, in a written novel, the way in which you play with the readers' emotion or the way in which you engage the readers' emotions can be very indirect.

"I have several close friends who are insomniacs. Over the years, I've heard their stories about being up in the middle of the night, completely awake. I see them yawn at 11 A.M. and know that, regardless of what they are doing, they'd probably rather be in bed sleeping. I've always had sympathy for them, but I've never really understood it.",Brad Feld,Sympathy

"Sometimes, in the midst of a tragedy like the Newton massacre, we witness incredible acts of valor, tenderness, grace, and decency.

"In order that people who suffer from depression seek treatment without a second thought, the stigmas must further fall until we reach a point in time when that person with leukemia and that person with depression both receive the same level of sympathy and the same level of rigorous treatment. Both people deserve it.",Gayle Forman,Sympathy
I've never wanted sympathy votes in anything I do in my life.,Amy Purdy,Sympathy
"In fiction, imaginary people become realer to us than any named celebrity glimpsed in a series of rumored events, whose causes and subtler ramifications must remain in the dark. An invented figure like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary emerges fully into the light of understanding, which brings with it identification, sympathy and pity.",John Updike,Sympathy

It's hard for me to think of others because I'm not particularly in sympathy with the music of this century.,Alan Hovhaness,Sympathy
"Ultimately, we'll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog.",James D. Watson,Sympathy
The American people didn't send us to Congress to post our sympathies on social media. You can do that without going through the trouble of getting elected to Congress. This job is about setting rules that better protect us and our children.,Chris Murphy,Sympathy

I have deep sympathy with the hundreds of my constituents who fear that legislation for same-sex marriage will profoundly encroach - although this may be unintended - on their right to live according to their faith.,Andrea Leadsom,Sympathy
It was no easy feat becoming Dominick Dunne. Think about it. He was the most celebrated chronicler of downtrodden socialites. He feasted on their famine with little sympathy or admiration for their formerly exalted positions. Yet somehow they invited him back.,Dan Abrams,Sympathy
"Pretty much all the drivers I get on with, at least to say 'Hi' and have a conversation. But when the helmet's on, you don't care who it is. You have no sympathy: someone blows an engine in front of you, if it means you gain a position, then you're smiling.",Daniel Ricciardo,Sympathy
"When you've been raised in care, rap music isn't just about guns and sexism. They're talking about real things you can hang on to, problems of identity that you have sympathy with.

Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.,Edward Gibbon,Sympathy

"I am convinced that, despite what you think of Obama, I don't think Obama has a person-to-person connection with people. I think people love him because of his race and feel sorry for him, object of sympathy. I think people feel he's a victim, he portrays himself as a victim of America; he gets sympathy that way.",Rush Limbaugh,Sympathy
"Too often, we get attention and sympathy by being a victim. If we're invested in someone being our villain, we must love being the victim. We have to let go of both characters in the story.",Regina Brett,Sympathy
