Or, God forbid, there's people who are going through hardship and wishing that this character would turn up and save them.",Henry Cavill,Faith
"Dawkins considers that all faith is blind faith, and that Christian and Muslim children are brought up to believe unquestioningly. Not even the dim-witted clerics who knocked me about at grammar school thought that.",Terry Eagleton,Faith

"My dad was enlisted in the Navy; my mother was a nurse. It just was never a thought process. It was just go to the best school you can go to, do the best you possibly can do, and be the best person you can possibly be, and I think our faith had a lot to do with that.",David Robinson,Faith
"Gosh, I think faith is a wonderful thing. And I even think religion's a wonderful thing. I know a lot of people want to say, 'Religion's the only reason that man has had any trouble at all,' but you know what? World War I and World War II were not fought because of religious reasons.",Kelsey Grammer,Faith

"We're so mixed up about religion in this culture. We say the Pledge of Allegiance, 'under God indivisible,' but there's no prayer in the schools. I would be so untethered without my personal faith. I wouldn't be able to go through a day - but that's my own experience.",Virginia Euwer Wolff,Faith
"Now they have come to the place where their faith can no longer feed on the bread of repression and violence. They ask for the bread of liberty, of public equality, and public responsibility. It must not be denied them.",Mordecai Wyatt Johnson,Faith

"Certain though I am - and ever more certain - that I must press on in life as though Christ awaited me at the term of the universe, at the same time I feel no special assurance of the existence of Christ. Believing is not seeing. As much as anyone, I imagine, I walk in the shadows of faith.",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,Faith
"Assurance, action, and evidence influence each other in an ongoing process. This helix is like a coil, and as it spirals upward it expands and widens.

"There's stuff going on in the world right now, which you can't imagine why is this happening; it's crazy.

"I'll tell you, in my life I've never once have seen a Hispanic panhandler, because in our community, it would be viewed as shameful to be out on the street begging. Those are all conservative values - faith, family, hard work, responsibility.",Ted Cruz,Faith
"I believe that the 'dark night of the soul' is a common spiritual experience. I believe, too, that the answer is continued seeking and perseverance. It helps to know that others have endured a loss of faith.",Julia Cameron,Faith

"9/11 allowed us to witness the ordinary face of goodness in the love that those about to die brought with them to work that day.

"I think my faith as a Muslim is very important. One of the core values is that you are always trying to build consensus.

"If we are too friendly to nice, decent bishops, we run the risk of buying into the fiction that there's something virtuous about believing things because of faith rather than because of evidence. We run the risk of betraying scientific enlightenment.",Richard Dawkins,Faith
Writing songs out of my faith was a real natural progression. I grew up singing in my dad's choir and singing with my family. Christian music became the music that I identified myself with and was a way that I expressed my faith. Even at a public school I would take my Christian music in and play it for my friends.,Steven Curtis Chapman,Faith

"There is far more misunderstanding of Islam than there is, I think, of the other religions of the world. So many things are said of it by those who do not belong to that faith.",Annie Besant,Faith
"Without our faith, we wouldn't have been able to succeed. On many occasions, before we'd go out on a sit-in, before we went on the freedom ride, before we marched from Selma to Montgomery, we would sing a song or say a prayer. Without our faith, without the spirit and spiritual bearings and underpinning, we would not have been so successful.",John Lewis,Faith

"In 1977, when I started my first job at the Federal Reserve Board as a staff economist in the Division of International Finance, it was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy: Central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future policy intentions.",Janet Yellen,Faith

The only thing that stands between a man and what he wants from life is often merely the will to try it and the faith to believe that it is possible.,David Viscott,Faith
"I have always marveled that so many religions exact such revenge against dissenters.

"Righteousness and faith certainly are instrumental in healing the sick, deaf, or lame - if such healing accomplishes God's purposes and is in accordance with His will.

"I think faith gives us a structure around which to try to organize our lives. I'm also a big believer, and very thankful that there's forgiveness.",Erik Prince,Faith
"You approach faith with humility. You can have some idea, but it boils down to do you see religion as a club, or do you see religion as a path?
