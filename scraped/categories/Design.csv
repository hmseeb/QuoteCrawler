"I've always liked working with an archetypal design, something functional.",Grayson Perry,Design
"Ultimately we may still ask, why can't humans design a perfect society?",Robert Shea,Design

"I've always made weird sounds with my mouth. I've always been fascinated by the sound design, what you can do with your mouth. I was the kid dancing around in third grade on the basketball court. While everyone would be playing sports, I would be jumping around.",Charlie Puth,Design

"Perhaps I'd like to design cars, but I don't think I'd be much good at it.",Jonathan Ive,Design

"Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good design for a bus.",David Hockney,Design
"I was a design ethicist at Google, where I studied how do you ethically steer people's thoughts?

Design is the courage and brilliance to cover an original and make it different.,John Hockenberry,Design

"Design should not dominate things, should not dominate people. It should help people. That's its role.",Dieter Rams,Design
"Design is a way of life, a point of view. It involves the whole complex of visual communications: talent, creative ability, manual skill, and technical knowledge. Aesthetics and economics, technology and psychology are intrinsically related to the process.",Paul Rand,Design

"I wanted to create a toolkit which I would have wanted as an entrepreneur to use these principles of psychology in product design. Some startups totally forget the trigger. In some, the action is too complicated. Others don't have a variable reward, which maintains mystery.",Nir Eyal,Design
"If you were to just design the perfect retirement plan, you would own the stock market or you would own the bond market. You would get all the costs or all that you possibly could out of the system.

"Over the past 20 years, I have noticed that the most flexible, dynamic, inquisitive minds among my students have been industrial design majors.

"Kanye West is a brilliant poet and artist. He and I work in a very similar way. We feel the vibration, the power of something, and it inspires us to create, whether it is music or design. It is the same process. Working with Kanye is a joy and great privilege. In 2012, we did collaboration together.",Giuseppe Zanotti,Design
I love design.,Venus Williams,Design

"There are people who design buildings that are not technically and financially good, and there are those who do. Two categories - simple.",Frank Gehry,Design
"Multitasking, throughput, efficiency - these are excellent machine concepts, useful in the design of computer systems. But are they principles that nurture human thought and imagination?",Ellen Ullman,Design
"I like entertainment and think mastery is good, though I don't feel like a master. If a theme means having a story that's legible, then that's certainly what we do. But we don't treat design as an add-on layer.",David Rockwell,Design
"When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.",Miuccia Prada,Design
"I think of makeup as more like a design, decoration, or jewelry. I mean, it's literally paint; it's art. I don't prefer to use it as concealing anything because it influences the illusion of standardized perfection.",Indya Moore,Design

"The math you need for most of finance is ninth-grade algebra, and most people feel reasonably comfortable with that.

Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we should be just as worried about premature design - designing too early what a program should do.,Paul Graham,Design
"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain.

"I would have killed to do 'Beauty And The Beast' at Warners, which went away. I would have killed to do 'The Witches' at Warners that went away. God knows there are many, many of them. All I can do is diligently do the screenplay, diligently do the design work, deliver a budget, and then await a decision.",Guillermo del Toro,Design
"In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.",Steve Jobs,Design
The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.,Victor Papanek,Design
"The great majority of Baghdad is a slum - a lot of it's new, but it's still slum. It's usually this concrete-block, one-room design with a door and a window, arranged one-up, one-down, often with a shop with nothing in it on the first floor, and then a one-room apartment above it. There's street after street after street of that stuff.",P. J. O'Rourke,Design
I like to choreograph and create and design the costumes and do it all and then step back and watch it and then move on to the next project.,Abby Lee Miller,Design

"Whether it's an $11 flip-flop or a $2 key ring or a $2,000 dress, they're all done with integrity. They're all done with a design sense. As long as the creativity exists, then I don't think it's a sellout. A sellout is putting your name on any piece of crap and then expecting people to buy it because it's got your name on it.",Marc Jacobs,Design
"I don't design. I get what I think is a big idea, and I put the idea down. I'm not a designer. I'm a communicator.",George Lois,Design

"Even before I was discovered in 1966, I used to make my own clothes. I learned how to sew early on, and it's still my passion now.

"I have no problem with the idea of comfort, but it is not an important thing aesthetically.

Of course, I am not putting nails in my shoes to ensure everybody is in pain, but a heel is not a pair of slippers and never will be.",Christian Louboutin,Design

"I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year, we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.",Stefan Sagmeister,Design

"I was just taught very early that if I didn't solve problems, I was headed for a very dark path. Problems were everywhere. Now, even if there are no problems, I look for problems. I'm like, 'You know what? I don't like the way this spoon works. I want to design a new spoon.'",Homaro Cantu,Design

"I don't particularly follow the Bauhaus school of design, where you make everything into a black box - simplify it.",James Dyson,Design
"While a case can be made for intelligent design, I can't figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all, it doesn't prove there's a God.

"There has to be the popcorn genre element, or I don't engage the same way. I like action and vehicle design and guns and computer graphics as much as I like allegory. It's a constant balancing game. I want audiences to be on this rollercoaster that fits the Hollywood mould, but I also want them to absorb my observations.",Neill Blomkamp,Design

"I don't differentiate game design and script; it is one and only document. I think that one of the biggest problem with storytelling in games is that people tend to separate story and interactivity. Both should be conceived as one entity, each using the other.",David Cage,Design
"I do what I love to do at the moment. If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to dance, that's what I'd do. Or design clothes. I think I'd throw myself into whatever I'm doing now. It's not about abandoning what I was doing before, or giving up. It's about knowing that if I die tomorrow, I lived the way I wanted to.",Ayumi Hamasaki,Design
"If you write your own tools, you can sort of see new things, design new things.",Saul Griffith,Design
"It was by design that we mostly used pictures that you could not necessarily see what was going on, and that didn't really focus in on the band, but instead focused in on a theme.",Mike McCready,Design
"With increasing fervor since the 1980s, sustainability has been the watchword of scientists, environmental activists, and indeed all those concerned about the complex, fragile systems on the sphere we inhabit. It has shaped debates about business, design, and our lifestyles.",Jamais Cascio,Design

"As a director, I design every movie to be true to itself, and damn it if they like it, and damn it if they don't.",Guillermo del Toro,Design
"To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.",I. M. Pei,Design
"We must carefully consider card security solutions, such as adding photographs or machine-readable electronic strips, so to prevent further breaches of individual privacy that could result from changes to the design of Social Security Cards.",Ron Lewis,Design

Safety is not just about trying really hard and being really careful. You have to design technology that makes it possible for a computer to be safe.,Jensen Huang,Design
English is taking over the world. I just wrote a piece about it. And it's not by design. The United States dominates because it's the biggest market.,Norman Spinrad,Design
"I can design a collection in a day and I always do, cause I've always got a load of Italians on my back, moaning that it's late.",Alexander McQueen,Design
"I don't like the collusion between high fashion design and high street. You have to know where you stand. I belong to luxury fashion. That's what I've always felt and embraced. I like the best quality, the best fabrics and the most creative field in fashion. I will stay consistent. I belong to this world.",Hedi Slimane,Design
"My favorite days are the ones where I deal only with my own team, design, marketing, working on the next accessories collection.",Diane von Furstenberg,Design

I help design my own tennis clothes.,Maria Sharapova,Design

"One of the things I've learned from animation is that some guys are really good at writing, some guys are really good at design, some guys are really good at directing. It's almost like working in a band - not everybody plays every instrument.",Paul Dini,Design
"If you want to communicate something, you'd better make sure that your design piece is well-dressed and that its teeth are fixed. At the same time, I still believe that if it is only stylistically great and it has nothing to say, it still is not going to make a lasting impression on anybody.",Stefan Sagmeister,Design
I didn't want to be an actor. I wanted to design historical movies like 'Ben-Hur'. I saw this as my life.,Dante Ferretti,Design
"Give us detailed, testable, mechanistic accounts for the origin of life, the origin of the genetic code, the origin of ubiquitous bio macromolecules and assemblages like the ribosome, and the origin of molecular machines like the bacterial flagellum, and intelligent design will die a quick and painless death.",William A. Dembski,Design

"Of course, I did lots of what would be called graphic design now, what used to be called commercial art.",Leonard Baskin,Design
"For me, unemployment and poverty in the Greater Montreal area is not mainly a problem of structure, or design, or statistics. It is a profoundly human situation.",Kim Campbell,Design

"When you're making a TV drama, the showrunner is God, and so however onerous and difficult and consuming that responsibility is, you're being treated with respect, so it changes your whole outlook to the production.

"And I think my sexuality was heavily repressed by the church, by the, you know, the design of the mortal sins.",Thomas Keneally,Design
"I wanted to be a writer as a teen... so storytelling was my first love. In my late teens, design became an obsession as I realized that I could express myself through the medium. Much later, when I founded Fuseproject in 1999, our slogan became 'design brings stories to life.'",Yves Behar,Design
"As an artist, as I design and lay out a page, the less-important things, things I want you to spend less time looking at, I draw them very small, maybe even silhouette them. The more-important pivotal scenes, I draw them larger, maybe even a double-page spread.",Jim Lee,Design
"To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object, but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale.",Greg Lynn,Design
"And then, build a bustling wonderful city of the 21st century, with a restoration of a spectacular skyline, which Manhattan, of course, needs. So, that is really the design as a whole.",Daniel Libeskind,Design

"Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.",Richard Dawkins,Design

I've always wanted to design clothes.,Skai Jackson,Design
"I do love DVD and I've always taken them seriously. You know, on the Austin things, we really put a ton of work into them because there's so much design involved. And in this one, we thought a lot about it and what could go in.",Jay Roach,Design
"I really appreciate artists of the 20th century, and I can see a lot of their influence on my work, but to suggest that my design only fits within an 'ism' kind of bothers me.",Michael Arad,Design

"Urban design as a discipline barely exists in most American and Canadian cities. In Singapore, there are innovative transportation strategies at work.",Moshe Safdie,Design

"In two days, it's hard to to get the quality you would normally want for a design project.",Douglas Wilson,Design
"I'm involved in everything from highly progressive lighting systems to airline interiors. In the field of transportation I can go from the micro to the macro: architecture, transportation, industrial product design, right across the board. It's Russian dollism, because they all interrelate: one goes into the other.",Ross Lovegrove,Design
"I don't have a background in design, so I think it's always about what I see in the world and what inspires me. So yes, I am designing for myself. I'm going through this whole evolution, which is a process of growing up and going from modeling to styling to designing.",Erin Wasson,Design
"The basic problem is that web 2.0 tools are not supportive of democracy by design. They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way, first and foremost, but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena.",Jaron Lanier,Design

"If there is a gay uniform, the differences are in how each man coordinates the details: the brand and cut of the jeans, the design of belts and boots, the haircut, the number and size of earrings.",Lance Loud,Design
"So many designers only sketch and leave pattern-making to others. Pattern-making is important so you know the structure. Then if someone tells me, 'I can't make a pattern from that sketch,' I can tell them, 'I will make it' and then they are quiet. If I can't make it, I don't design it.",Tadashi Shoji,Design
"By divine design, men and women are intended to progress together toward perfection and a fulness of glory. Because of their distinctive temperaments and capacities, males and females each bring to a marriage relationship unique perspectives and experiences.",David A. Bednar,Design
"Being a sculptor who uses found objects, all the objects I use in my work have been designed by other people. So I'm tweaking them in some way by squashing them or throwing them off cliffs! Then I formalise my damage by suspending them or arranging them in some kind of way. So I'm using other people's design in a way, so I'm an 'un-maker.'",Cornelia Parker,Design
"By no definition of any modern scientist is intelligent design science, and it's a waste of our students' time to subject them to it.",Lawrence M. Krauss,Design
"When you say 'design,' everybody thinks of magazine pages. So it's an emotive word. Everybody thinks it's how something looks, whereas for me, design is pretty much everything.",James Dyson,Design

I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.,Zaha Hadid,Design
"I went through the workroom at Central Saint Martins in London, which is the most competitive workroom of a design school in the world. Very high creativity, very conceptual, very international, age-diverse and cutthroat - people who have master degrees reapplying into a foundation there is just wild to me to launch their careers.",Zac Posen,Design
"Design schools are good, I guess, sometimes I visit schools, but they are very very limiting.",Marc Newson,Design
"The sky is a free asset in design, and nothing unnecessary should be planted that takes away the sky.",Rachel Lambert Mellon,Design

Species go extinct because there are historical contraints built into a given body or a given design.,Kevin Kelly,Design
It turns out it's not rocket science to design a sacred space.,Greg Lynn,Design
"I like to be surrounded by books. My wife Evelyn has a Ph.D. in comparative literature, so we have a lot of her Spanish and German literature books which are wasted on me, plus a lot of novels and books on art and architecture shared by us both. Evelyn used to edit an art magazine called 'FMR,' so we have a common interest in design.",David Chipperfield,Design
McSweeney's as a publishing company is built on a business model that only works when we sell physical books. So we try to put a lot of effort into the design and production of the book-as-object.,Dave Eggers,Design

"A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with, that have been trained in my vision, and they do what they think I might do. They might come in the office and ask me questions and I'd certainly answer their questions, but I'm not involved in the site visits or anything else.",Jack Nicklaus,Design
"It was something I was more interested in myself. When I went to see my sister dance at ballet, I was really into costumes and the arts, and my family was also supportive of whatever me and my sister wanted to do. I would say I pushed myself the most to be into design.",Christian Siriano,Design
"Graphic Design, which fulfills aesthetic needs, complies with the laws of form and exigencies of two-dimensional space; which speaks in semiotics, sans-serifs, and geometrics; which abstracts, transforms, translates, rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors, groups, and regroups, is not good design if it is irrelevant.",Paul Rand,Design
I think a lot of times people design restaurants with flash in mind. I think you should design restaurants with function in mind. Make sure it's functional and works with what you're trying to accomplish. Design can come later.,Bobby Flay,Design
I could design an $800 shoe line; it's easy. You use the best materials and you can make beautiful shoes. It's easier than making great shoes for $90.,Steve Madden,Design
"The first 10 years of my professional life had only to do with running away from my father. He was a wonderful cabinet-maker, and me being the eldest son, I had to take over his shop, his profession and so on and so on. I tried to escape by going to art school and then going on to industrial design and then interior design.",Peter Zumthor,Design
I love every period in design history. Even the ugly ones.,Catherine Martin,Design
Readers always seem to think that the author has some control over the design of their books.,Donald Norman,Design
"A new 'look' for any organization cannot be a papier-mache cover, tacked on with Scotch tape under the heading of 'beautification.' It has to be based on a probing examination of the company and the people who work for it. As a result, the eventual external visual design becomes the graphic extension of the internal realities of a company.",Saul Bass,Design
Eight years of work can be copied in six months. It wasn't inevitable that it was going to work. A stolen design is stolen time.,Jonathan Ive,Design
"Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?",Jason Reitman,Design
I think taking design out of the studio and really having a relationship with the people that you're making it for really convinced me of how powerful a thing design is. It's not just an aesthetic decoration.,Genevieve Gorder,Design

"I never wanted to work in fashion. At age 12 or 13, I wanted to design for showgirls - for the theater! And I was crazy for the Hollywood of the 1950s: Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Jones. They were my idea of glamour - and Sylvie Vartan, the French singer.",Christian Louboutin,Design
Longhorns are unique - each and every one of them is a different color with a different design.,Janine Turner,Design
"The problem with State of the Union speeches is that they are, by their nature and design, alphabet soup. It's hard to know what a president really cares about when they run down a laundry list and check every issue box under the sun for fear they will offend some constituency if they don't.",Mark McKinnon,Design
"Received wisdom is that if you spend time up front getting the design right, you avoid costs later. But the longer you spend getting the design right, the more your upfront costs are, and the longer it takes for the software to start earning.",Kent Beck,Design
"Usually I design the lighting and when I have the physical set there, I'm not good at going out loosely and saying, 'Do you what you want, give it to the editor, and he'll figure it out.' I physically then walk on with the actors and I say, 'Let's walk until you guys feel the space works for you, and tell me when all that happens.'",Tarsem Singh,Design
"I'm not really well educated - other than an art survey course at the High School of Art and Design in New York when I was, like, 15. I don't know the history of art, but I got over intimidation from the art world when I realized that I was allowed to feel whatever I want and like whatever I want.",Marc Jacobs,Design
"Many, many times I find that whatever is looking good on the screen doesn't always look or feel good on the body. So who do we design for - do we design for the screen, or do we design for women?",Alber Elbaz,Design
"To me, 'design thinking' is another way of saying empathize with the customer. It's consideration for the person you're designing for.",Joe Gebbia,Design
"Independent graphic novelists have already achieved good work in terms of design, but all these great minds are writing in English. There is a need for people to write in Hindi.",Anurag Kashyap,Design
"I love the creative outlet of designing, and I love make-up and products and feel like I find so many great products around the world that I want to recreate, so I want to do that or design.",Jessica Hart,Design

I design for the working girl.,Elsa Peretti,Design
"I wouldn't like to live in a castle now, but I'd enjoy a visit to Restormel in Cornwall in its 13th century prime. It's a circular castle with the rooms built against the outer walls and quite intimate in size. Life there wouldn't follow the pattern of more classic castle design.",Jo Beverley,Design

"I always try to design fashion that is interesting and innovative, and I like to break traditions and challenge people's expectations.",Jonathan Anderson,Design

"You can almost say that a design error is a human error because, after all, it's we humans who do the designing.",Henry Petroski,Design
"Developing games for the PC and consoles is all about everything and the kitchen sink. In many ways, you don't have design decisions to make. You do it all. So I enjoy going back to making decisions about what's important as I'm working on a game.",John Carmack,Design
"I'm going to design again, but I come back when it's the right project, so I keep my passion for it intact.",Hedi Slimane,Design

"When the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city in 1666, Christopher Wren was invited to design a new one. Within days, he had drawn up an elegant grid of broad boulevards leading to majestic squares, but it came to nothing - the existing landowners wanted things as they had been.",Norman Foster,Design
"When you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology, basically failed developed world technology, then you will crush that community way beyond bad design; you'll destroy the economics of that community, and often the community socially is broken.",Cameron Sinclair,Design
"If I was influenced by anything, it was architecture: structure having to do with logic. If you don't do it right, the whole thing is going to cave in. In a certain sense, you can carry that to graphic design. Fortunately, however, nobody is going to die if you do it wrong.",Paul Rand,Design

"No one who set out to design a form of communication would ever end up with anything like English, Mandarin, or any of the more than six thousand languages spoken today.",Joshua Foer,Design
"I was in college, and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time, it seemed the thing I really wanted to do, production design, just wasn't available in the U.K., so I turned to music.",Eric Burdon,Design
"Through all aspects of society be it art, design, the financial markets, government, technology or communications we are witnessing unprecedented global transformation - the result of which is impossible to predict.",Malcolm Mclaren,Design
"Punk's influence on music, movies, art, design and fashion is no longer in doubt. It is used as the measurement for what is cool.",Malcolm Mclaren,Design
"I'm not into politics but I am committed to a cause: ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the U.K. curriculum, alongside science and maths - grounding abstract theory, merging the practical with the academic.",James Dyson,Design
"Britain's great strength is its innovative, design and engineering natural ability and we're not using it.",James Dyson,Design
I don't design down to a price.,James Dyson,Design
So much of design is context.,Steve Madden,Design
I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain; I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.,Florence Welch,Design
"I like the personality of the Belgians. They're deeply eccentric, which is something that comes across in their design - terrific.",Miranda Richardson,Design
"Websites are kind of useless. There's so much great web content and design out there, but the ways in which they are being experienced are not being maximized.",Dhani Harrison,Design
"If you were the first person ever to design an application for the iPhone and you patented it, you would be very, very better off than we are right now, you know? But you've got to be the first one to do it. So I figured that Led Zeppelin or the Stones were going to do it unless we just got on to it. So I got cracking with the guys from Apple.",Dhani Harrison,Design
"I'm constantly thinking about design, shapes, patterns and colors, so I just want to be more of a blank canvas. But there is a comfort in knowing what you're going to wear, and that probably comes from Catholic school, where I wore a uniform for 10 years.",Prabal Gurung,Design
"Nearly all inventions are not recognised for their positive side either when they're made. So, for example, scientists didn't go out to design a CD machine: they designed a laser. But we got all sorts of things from a laser which we never remotely imagined, and we're still finding things for a laser to do.",Robert Winston,Design
"NPR editors and journalists found themselves caught in a game of trying to please a leadership team who did not want to hear stories on the air about conservatives, the poor, or anyone who didn't fit their profitable design of NPR as the official voice of college-educated, white, liberal-leaning, upper-income America.",Juan Williams,Design
"Like many other scientists who hold the Catholic faith, I see the Creator's plan and purpose fulfilled in our universe. I see a planet bursting with evolutionary possibilities, a continuing creation in which the Divine providence is manifest in every living thing. I see a science that tells us there is indeed a design to life.",Kenneth R. Miller,Design
"I majored in illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design, although I never had any intention of being an illustrator and didn't take any classes in illustration there. It was just that the illustration degree had no requirements.",Brian Selznick,Design
"The craftless anarchy of the Beat poets on the one hand, and the extreme control of Henry James on the other, suggest that for most human beings, just as both freedom and discipline are necessary in life, serendipity and design must coexist in a work to make it readable.",Mark Helprin,Design
"By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art. The Sloane domestic aesthetic - symmetry, class symbolism and brown furniture - became as unfashionable as it had been hot in the early Eighties.",Peter York,Design
"There is an interior style we intellectuals and design policy wonks know as Haut Euro Pooftastic, which really takes the biscuit.",Peter York,Design
"All brands, whether high-ticket luxury ones such as Cartier or Rolls-Royce or 'masstige' ones with luxe-y overtones but altogether more affordable, all want to grow. Even brands that may have started in a modestly niche design and lifestyle fashion can find themselves under pressure to go global or to sell out at the top.",Peter York,Design
I'd love to design a school.,Nolan Bushnell,Design
"I'm not too fond of really cool design. I've got quite kitsch taste really, in things like tableware. I'm quite a sucker for 1930s pressed glass.",Kevin McCloud,Design
The illusion of purpose and design is perhaps the most pervasive illusion about nature that science has to confront on a daily basis.,Lawrence M. Krauss,Design
"Intelligent design is consistent with any faith system I can think of, because most faith systems believe that there is a creator.",Lee Strobel,Design
I have to experience the Nokia products. I'm a major contributor to the design and the quality of the devices. I have a lot of feedback to provide the teams on that. But also I have to carry competitive devices. You have to understand the competition.,Stephen Elop,Design
"For all the drama we all have with our families and all the tension and hostility, I couldn't have done this without my family. Being the people that they are - they're crazy - made it possible for me to be crazy and to live a lifestyle of my own design.",Dan Colen,Design
"I'm also interested in pets with alopecia. And design. I'm surprised I haven't gone through with a homeware brand. The bedding, the comforters, the candles, the this and that. I would like to design everything.",Lisa Vanderpump,Design
"People interact with their phones very differently than they do with their PCs, and I think that when you design from the ground up with mobile in mind, you create a very different product than going the other way.",Kevin Systrom,Design
The debate that I'm interested in having is with seriously smart people about how we design institutions in the 21st century that will genuinely address problems of poverty and educational underachievement.,Niall Ferguson,Design
"Intelligent design, unlike creationism, is a science in its own right and can stand on its own feet.",William A. Dembski,Design
"Precisely because intelligent design does not turn the study of biological origins into a Bible-science controversy, intelligent design is a position around which Christians of all stripes can unite.",William A. Dembski,Design
"Just like zillions of children, album covers educated and informed me, and certainly did I later transpose organically, rather than by intent, those principles both in fashion design and photography.",Hedi Slimane,Design

"I'd love to design stuff that I'd like to wear and that other people could wear, too.",Dionne Bromfield,Design
"I am interested in the idea of 'taste.' And by 'taste,' I mean opinion, inspiration and the craft of creating a personality through fabric and design.",Olivier Theyskens,Design
I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.,Zooey Deschanel,Design
"Google has placed its faith in data, while Apple worships the power of design. This dichotomy made the two companies complementary. Apple would ship the phones and computers, while Google would provide Maps, Search, YouTube, and other web tools that made the devices more useful.",Ben Parr,Design
I studied to be an architect. And I find tremendous similarities between building a company and the design process. Businesses have to do their planning on the fly in a fashion similar to an architect sketching.,John Katzman,Design
"When I was a very little boy, I lived underneath the air pattern of LaGuardia airport in New York and I watched the planes fly to their destinations. I was in love with the design of these airplanes.",John Travolta,Design
"I design for the use of a building and the place and for the people who use it... the reputation for arrogance comes because when work is offered to me, I look whether I can find a genuine interest in quality.",Peter Zumthor,Design
"I had always wanted to expand to beauty, but I knew I wanted to be able to translate my design aesthetic in an authentic way.",Charlotte Ronson,Design
I really liked the design of Batman. I liked the concept. There's a lot more you can do with Batman than most other superheroes.,Chip Kidd,Design
"When we launched If WeRanTheWorld, I said to my team, I want us to innovate in every aspect of how we design and operate this as a business venture, as much as the web platform itself - because I want us to design our own startup around the working lives that we would all like to live. Women and men alike.",Cindy Gallop,Design
"Uniqlo as a company has always developed new fabrics and is always trying to be innovative. The design is simple, so the fabric is important.",Nicola Formichetti,Design
"Due to the failure of politics, which has become a process of middle-management, art has become one of the last open spaces to question core beliefs and to design a viable future. Art becomes an open space where we can ask fundamental questions about ourselves.",Antony Gormley,Design
"It's a Japanese way of thinking, that I give value for my merchandise. So I don't want to sell unnecessarily expensive dresses and make just 10 or 20 and then feel satisfied. I want to design for real women who can afford my dresses.",Tadashi Shoji,Design
"Magazines that depend on photography, and design, and long reads, and quality stuff, are going to do just fine despite the Internet and cable news.",Jann Wenner,Design
"What people respond to in my room makeovers is the daring design - fearless colors, bold fabrics and occasionally outlandish decor.",Douglas Wilson,Design
"I love fashion, and I've always wanted to do costume design, but I'm in jeans and T-shirts most of the time.",Clemence Poesy,Design
"When I meet celebrities, I have to know what they are like and only then can I design. The clothes have to fit their personality.",Donatella Versace,Design
"Modernism, rebelling against the ornament of the 19th century, limited the vocabulary of the designer. Modernism emphasized straight lines, eliminating the expressive S curve. This made it harder to communicate emotions through design.",Eva Zeisel,Design
Men have no concept of how to design things for the home. Women should design the things they use.,Eva Zeisel,Design
My studio cube is an experiment in solar heating and design. The south wall is covered with glass planks that collect and distribute heat naturally to my work studio on the second level.,Steven Holl,Design
"Surprisingly, the Eisenhower Memorial design contains almost none of the known Gehry-box of tricks. His giant etched chain-link curtain, first applied in 1979 to hide an ungracious parking garage at Santa Monica Place, is resurrected for Eisenhower to screen the equally graceless facade of the Department of Education.",Leon Krier,Design
"Anything I do informs how I design. I wouldn't isolate any one activity. Everything I do feeds back to my life, and my life is expressed in my work.",Antoine Predock,Design
Architects feel empowered to give opinions about politics and sociology and philosophy without knowing much about it. Kind of in the same way that they think they can design furniture or fashion or utensils for dining.,Rafael Vinoly,Design
"I always wanted to be an actor, but I always loved design, and growing up in New Orleans there was such great style, great architecture. I would decorate my little apartment in New York over and over again, because it only had a couple of rooms. And I did it for friends and family on the side just for fun.",Bryan Batt,Design
"I never was interested in being part of the fashion world - I just wanted to design shoes. I didn't even know 'Vogue' existed when I was growing up. 'Vogue,' what is that?'",Christian Louboutin,Design
"I never wanted to design clothes. I never wanted to work for the fashion industry. Shoes sort of belong to the fashion industry, which is why I'm part of the fashion industry. But that's never been my thought. My thought since I was a child was really to design those shoes for girls on stage.",Christian Louboutin,Design
"With everything that I design, from a church to a plate to skyscraper to a spoon. I am always thinking about voluptuous volumes and spaces.",Greg Lynn,Design
"Similar to computer technology in the '60s, 3-D printing is a universal technology that has the potential to revolutionize our life by enabling individuals to design and manufacture things.",Hod Lipson,Design
Schoolchildren are not taught how to distinguish accurate information from inaccurate information online - surely there are ways to design web-browsers to help with this task and ways to teach young people how to use the powerful online tools available to them.,Howard Rheingold,Design
"The genome was once thought to be just the blueprint for a living organism, like a combination of the architect's plan for a building and the builder's list of supplies. It specified the parts, the building blocks, and, somehow, the design of the whole, the way in which they are to be put together.",Iain McGilchrist,Design
The design of a city is like a strange archeology.,Jaime Lerner,Design
"Preventing global warming from becoming a planetary catastrophe may take something even more drastic than renewable energy, superefficient urban design, and global carbon taxes.",Jamais Cascio,Design
"I specialise in taking teams of designers, psychologists, usability experts, sociologists and ethnographers into the field. It's called 'corporate anthropology,' but personally I'm more comfortable with 'design research,' because I'm not an anthropologist by training.",Jan Chipchase,Design
"For businesses, biomimicry is about bringing a new discipline - biology - to the design table. It's not to write an environmental impact statement, as most biologists in business do right now.",Janine Benyus,Design
"Every single item that we come into contact with on a daily basis has been designed by an artist. From the toothbrush we use in the morning, to the defibrillator that could save our lives, an artist is behind the design.",Jarrett J. Krosoczka,Design
"If I wasn't an actress, I'd be a designer. I love interior design and inventing things that are practical but also beautiful - looking at a space and creating magic.",Deborra-Lee Furness,Design
"Design certainly has a cosmetic, aesthetic aim. It always aims at making things beautiful. But relevance is just as important. I often say, 'If it isn't ethical, it can't be beautiful. But if it isn't beautiful, it probably shouldn't be at all.'",Yves Behar,Design
"What I learned from my years in Silicon Valley is that design can have a primary role in how a business is shaped, how a company can be design-driven. In my experience of large industry in Europe, that knowledge has been lost.",Yves Behar,Design
"I'm completely taken and impressed by the planning authority of Singapore and its Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). It's the most cutting-edge agency in the world. They have very effective guidelines for development, and they review design as it evolves.",Moshe Safdie,Design

"The emphasis and value on ideas and original thinking is an innate part of British culture, and in many ways, that describes the traditions of design.",Jonathan Ive,Design

"I think, aesthetically, car design is so interesting - the dashboards, the steering wheels, and the beauty of the mechanics. I don't know how any of it works, I don't want to know, but it's inspirational.",Paloma Picasso,Design
"Even when I was a little girl, I remember going to the Museum of Modern Art. I think my parents took me there once or twice. And what I really remember is the design collection.",Barbara Kruger,Design
"I grew up as an artist. Science fiction allows for design and creatures and guns and all the stuff that I like as well. So I think most of the films I make, I'm sure, will be in that category. But I can also see myself making a film like 'Black Hawk Down,' and I could also totally do horror.",Neill Blomkamp,Design
"I had talked for years about doing a restaurant with Rocky Dudum, who's been my friend since I first came to San Francisco. Then Rocky's son, Jeff, said he wanted to design it, so he traveled around the country to sports restaurants like Mickey Mantle's and Michael Jordan's, and he came up with a great concept.",Willie McCovey,Design
The way I design generally is very much travel-oriented because that is my life. That's why I make clothes that are so light and so easy to pack and a little bit seasonless.,Diane von Furstenberg,Design

"I began doing writing projects and art and design projects to explore a new way of seeing Canada. Roots is one more way of continuing this exploration. I want to present a wide-open Canadian sense of color, adventure, communication and openness that defines our country.",Douglas Coupland,Design
"I love design in general, the creativity. Whether it is golf courses, my apparel line, ads we do or our business with AriZona, design is fun.",Jack Nicklaus,Design
"Hey, I'm a good software engineer, but I'm not exactly known for my fashion sense. White socks and sandals don't translate to 'good design sense'.",Linus Torvalds,Design
"There's good movies and there's bad movies. The genres are never dead, it's just about how to apply them and articulate them and execute them - the story, the quality of the writing, the acting, the design elements, the directorial execution - all these things make it what it is.",Andy Garcia,Design
"I like the idea of people who've had some success in one form secretly wanting to be something else; I have some of that myself. I look for it in other people who've established themselves in some particular art form, and then you find out that they really would like to design running shoes, or edit literary magazines or something.",William Gibson,Design
"We don't design by calculator or by demographics or anything like that. We really are a group of creative, sensitive people. We have our charmed little world where we get to make things. We're really lucky.",Marc Jacobs,Design
"My guilty pleasure is I like to watch a lot of HGTV. I really like watching design shows about houses, like extreme homes. Like buying a bridge and turning it into a house or something like that. I really am interested in home design or something like that... architecture.",Taylor Schilling,Design
"I love French auto design of the early '50s, '60s, early '70s of Citorens, Renaults, and Peugeots. They're so unique.",John Lasseter,Design
"Nike is the uniform for kids all over the world, and African design has been killed by Nike. Africans no longer want to wear their own designs.",M.I.A.,Design
"I'm fascinated with design. I realized early that I had no talent in that direction, but I love talking with architects and designers about what they do. I appreciate applied creativity as a source of pleasure and meaning.",Alex Steffen,Design
The big deal about the Internet design was you could have an arbitrary large number of networks so that they would all work together.,Vint Cerf,Design
"I would urge everyone to start looking at the world in a different way. Spend some time looking at everyday objects, at their design, their shape, their individual characteristics. Think ahead and imagine their significance.",Martin Parr,Design
"When I studied graphic design, I learned a valuable lesson: There's no perfect answer to the puzzle, and creativity is a renewable resource.",Biz Stone,Design
"Tiles, the best furniture, fabrics, bath fixtures, bronze - just leaf through any design magazine and you immediately understand they're all 'Made in Italy.' We have the premier opera house in the world, La Scala, and behind the Nobel given to CERN is the research of many Italians.",Lapo Elkann,Design
"Books are the heart of any home, and I spend hours going through books for design inspiration.",Nate Berkus,Design
"When I take on a design project, I have to jet from the bookstore to the hardware shop to the lamp store and back again just to collect a small portion of the many items I need to fill a home. But, when you hit the flea market, they're all right there. From booth to booth, you have the bases covered.",Nate Berkus,Design
"I didn't grow up thinking I'd be a decorator. Design is my greatest passion, and it naturally just pulled me down the path. Same with TV. Being famous or having a show was never the motivation. I got a call and was swept up by the challenge of that first small space redesign.",Nate Berkus,Design
"First and foremost, I'm a decorator and product designer. Everything I do, the television shows, the books, that comes from the design work. It's what I love.",Nate Berkus,Design
I came from product design originally - I had been designing dolls for a toy company since I was 16 - so I'm used to working with plastic and different things. I had an innate interest in objects.,Jason Wu,Design
