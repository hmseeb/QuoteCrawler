It's a boundary violation.",Caroline Knapp,Pet

Surely any man can appreciate the practicality of this choice.",Iliza Shlesinger,Pet

"When I was pregnant with my first child, I was 35 years old, and I was working in a pet shop.",Ann Dowd,Pet
"It's not easy to make people laugh. You can make people cry, there are are universal things that we all feel; a pet dog dying, we're all going to cry. For horror you can give someone a jump-scare, but to make someone laugh is so tough, because everyone has a different sense of humour.",Asim Chaudhry,Pet
"Some people - which I don't understand - kind of get mad like I'm disrespecting shoes. I'm like, 'They are sneakers, they are meant to be worn, meant to be played in.' And I hate when people use them as trophies. They are sneakers. It's one of my pet peeves. I got pairs if I don't want to wear, I will get a couple pairs of them.",P. J. Tucker,Pet
Learning about factory farms and their horrendous treatment of animals is what made me become vegetarian in the first place.

"A pet store is a celebration of dogs' existence and an explosion of options. About cats, a pet store seems to say, 'Here, we couldn't think of anything else.' Cats are the Hanukkah of the animal world in this way. They are feted quietly and happily by a minority, but there's only so much hoopla applicable to them.",Sloane Crosley,Pet
Spoiled is when humans put their pet's comfort before their own.,Beth Ostrosky Stern,Pet
I do not believe that I will ever write an adult novel from an animal's point of view unless someday it becomes suddenly appealing to me to make a narrator a mentally ill pet. Never say never.,Andrea Seigel,Pet

"My best time to write is right after coffee and breakfast - four eggs - because, full disclosure, I'm really a komodo dragon - and that's because then I'm energized but not so awake that the critical voice clicks on, the voice that sometimes says, 'Don't write that,' or, 'Man, that sentence is terrible - you should give up and go pet the cats.'",Jeff Vandermeer,Pet

We all have our pet things that we like to get religious about.,Max Cannon,Pet
"It might seem strange to feast on Guinea pig, but Ecuadorians love to eat cuy. Personally, I think it's a phenomenal alternative to pork or chicken. High in protein, low in fat, cheap and easy to raise. Oh, and cuy tastes great, much like roast pig. You might call it a pet, but I prefer to call it dinner.",Andrew Zimmern,Pet
"If you're trying to cut down the distance travelled from the farm to your plate, it makes sense to do the same for your pet. If we all shifted our bias towards sustainable pet food, we would be helping more than just our faithful friends.",Sheherazade Goldsmith,Pet

"Though each trainer believes his or her method is best, I don't think it matters which method the pet owner adopts so long as that owner finds a capable mentor and sticks with the training.

I was over that quick, fast and in a hurry.",Keshia Knight Pulliam,Pet
"For every book that I write... I develop a history for each person and make sure they are well rounded and flawed.

I noticed that on the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' record they could get away with racy lyrics like that because of how they looked and the melodic way they sang the suggestive stuff. They slid it by the censors.,Eric Carmen,Pet

"My big pet peeve with people posting food - and I love it when people post food - but my number one thing is when you're posting at a restaurant, and it's dark, like a date night, food never looks good.

"When it comes to the great either/or of pet ownership, I am definitely a cat person.",Susanna Reid,Pet

"In their heyday, the Pet Shop Boys were the Interpol of the Eighties, dressing up to sing really weird pop songs about lust and loneliness in the big city.

"It's just so nice when your pet isn't all needy. I need a lot of space, so dogs suffocate me.",Kerli,Pet

"Just like hair frames our face, brows frame our eyes. I see so much potential in harmonized beauty whenever I see a woman who's not filling in her brows, and I just want to go in with my brow pencil and just be like, 'Filling in eyebrows, OK, done - look in the mirror and be inspired.' That's one of my pet peeves, but beauty is subjective.",Michelle Phan,Pet

"Having an animal that you fix, knowing that you saved its life or you saved a pet - Like on a dog, these little kids will come, and their dog is just ready to die, and you do something, and they leave happy.

"As a child, the most important people in my life were my pet rabbit and Mary, mother of Jesus.",Sean Scully,Pet
"Humans should always exercise and watch what they eat.

"I had a big Akita, Yoshi, who was fabulous. I loved him. We lost him when he was 12, and I've never been able to replace him. Normally, most people lose a pet and get another and keep going on. But it just felt wrong to me; it felt disloyal.",Robert Crais,Pet

"Our pets rely on us entirely for their nutrition. So if you're making your own judgments, that could lead to a mistake.

I feel like they tend to be either depicted in a very sentimental way, where everybody has a heart of gold except for the villains you're supposed to hiss at, or there's a sort of indie-style version...

"I love animals. I just don't want to have a pet. That's OK, right? I would take a dog over a cat, at least to interact with you. I feel like cats just stare you down all the time. Cats have, like, bad attitudes.",Erin Foster,Pet

"Women are often scrutinized when they have pets that men wouldn't have. We are immediately faulted for having the wrong kind of pet rather than anyone first think, 'Wow, she rescued an animal that would have been otherwise killed and gave them a great home - how sweet!'",Iliza Shlesinger,Pet
I've never written a 'Revolver' or a 'Pet Sounds.',Richard Ashcroft,Pet
"There are conventions for people with serious, boring inventions, but fad inventors need help. You need someone to talk to.

"You can scroll through my iTunes and I've got everything.

"I hate those articles - this is a pet peeve of mine - like move over X, here's the new Y. And it's just like, X didn't become obsolete because there's a person doing a similar thing. You also don't have to be like the new old-thing, you're just the current you-thing.",Julien Baker,Pet

A pet around a small child teaches them responsibility and passion.,Gemma Atkinson,Pet
"I started out in 1989 doing open mic nights. The first 10 years, I was literally all about I'm going to be a star.
