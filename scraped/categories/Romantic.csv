"They are just really stupid people in Hollywood. You write them a script, and they say they love it, they absolutely love it.

"I like doing comedy, I like doing drama. Naturally I like to do, I like doing dramas, I like conflict, and when I do a comedy, you know, I've found that, like, romantic comedy is the trickiest one, because often it's neither: it's not romantic and it's not funny. So, like, I like a comedy that's biting. It's biting humor or really quirky humor.",Matt Dillon,Romantic

There are so many more stories than that.,Greta Gerwig,Romantic
"'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon.

"I always thought 'chick lit' meant third-person contemporary funny novels, dealing with issues of the day. I mean, it's not the ideal term; when I'm asked to describe what I do, I say I write romantic comedies, cause that's what I feel they are. But I'm quite pragmatic.",Sophie Kinsella,Romantic
"As an actor, I've grown considerably. For example, it's taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience.

"I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously.

"I've been interested in the idea of forgiveness and the necessity of it. I think of it as the most critical piece of any relationship, whether that be business, or romantic, or familial. We fail each other. We make mistakes. If we contract to go on after those mistakes, forgiveness is involved. Forgiveness is required.",Bill Clegg,Romantic

I think laughter and stimulating conversation are the things that truly make a romantic evening.,Michael Buble,Romantic
"The idea of romantic heroes - When you say the word hero,' it implies it's someone you look up to. We talk a lot with Bridgerton' about it being female-centric, but also, what are men looking up to? What am I doing with this icon of masculinity?",Rege-Jean Page,Romantic
"I think I meant that, given the circumstances of my childhood, I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone.

"I have a romantic conception of the writer's life, and the sort of writer's life that I admire is probably a childless life, possibly a marriageless life, certainly a travelling life - I'm in awe of how much D.H.

"I'm a very loyal boyfriend. I'm a bit of a joker... I can be romantic, but not too sickly.",Louis Tomlinson,Romantic

"German accents and Hassidic accents aren't that romantic. They're more harsh. Although Hebrew, when spoken by certain people, sounds beautiful. There's this beautiful woman I know who speaks Hebrew, and when she speaks, it's so attractive. Maybe it's who's speaking it.",Janeane Garofalo,Romantic
"I am such a sap when it comes to love! I believe in love at first sight all the way. But that's just the way it happened to me with my relationships.

"I am a romantic, in a literary way, by which I mean the Romantic poets, who thought just because a sensation is fleeting doesn't mean it isn't valuable. If the only criterion of value is whether something lasts, then the whole of human life is a waste of time.",Sebastian Faulks,Romantic

"When I was growing up, my favorite movie was 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve, which is a hugely romantic, sappy movie. I couldn't understand it when the guy didn't get the girl or the girl didn't get the guy in love stories. I was definitely a sap.",Scott Michael Foster,Romantic
"Ooh, it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic.

Well my biggest dream is to be in a romantic comedy.,Izabella Scorupco,Romantic

"My dream role would probably be a psycho killer, because the whole thing I love about movies is that you get to do things you could never do in real life, and that would be my way of vicariously experiencing being a psycho killer. Also, it's incredibly romantic.",Christina Ricci,Romantic

"When I was younger, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do, but I told a lot of lies in school. I told my friends once that I was playing John Travolta's daughter in a movie. I also told people that I had this romantic affair with Jonathan Taylor Thomas over a summer.",Meaghan Rath,Romantic
"I think when romantic comedies are done well, it's a great genre. 'When Harry Met Sally' is kind of a benchmark for me, but I'm very happy to admit that I love 'Pretty Woman.' I do! It's a great film, and so is 'Sixteen Candles.' I was a big John Hughes fan - still am. I have moments where I have to watch a Hughes film.",Jamie Dornan,Romantic

"It's glorious to be able to go onto the Internet and hear any kind of music anywhere, from anywhere, and get it instantly.

I am a romantic at heart.,Gautham Menon,Romantic
"Essentially, I spent most of my childhood with my mother and my older sister, and I suppose I had rather a romantic vision of how things might be if there were men around; I saw myself in a country house with six children and a garden.

"I loved it. I just thought I wanted to stay in college forever. I came to New York all by myself; I didn't have any friends there. But it was fine. I felt comfortable. I started thinking, 'Maybe graduate school?' I was really cool with people who were smart, who knew stuff. It's very romantic and stimulating.",Alice Smith,Romantic
"We don't tend to write about disease in fiction - not just teen novels but all American novels - because it doesn't fit in with our idea of the heroic romantic epic. There is room only for sacrifice, heroism, war, politics and family struggle.",John Green,Romantic

"So I'm still in my romantic stage with London, I love it as a place.",Christian Cooke,Romantic
"Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries famously lasted 72 days, and was reported in the tabloids as being all about the big bucks paid by magazines for the bridal photos: it is a spectacle of a bride-to-be as entrepreneur, not as romantic heroine; the groom, in this scenario, is nothing but a prop.",Naomi Wolf,Romantic
There are very few movies in English about romantic obsession told with a seriousness of purpose.,James Gray,Romantic
I read too many romance novels during my formative years. I have a penchant for romantic comedies. I understand why 'Romeo and Juliet' came to such a pass.,Roxane Gay,Romantic
"For me, the perfect romantic suspense hero has got to be tough on the outside but tender at his core. A take-charge kind of guy who has his own inner strength and a strong sense of right and wrong - which might not dovetail with the conventional wisdom. I mean, he might bend the law if he thinks the ends justify the means.",Ruth Glick,Romantic
"I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way,' I was really thinking about my wife. People don't know my personal experience, but they can tell it's an honest interpretation.","Harry Connick, Jr.",Romantic

"People love to be listened to and represented, and they love it when they feel like you have some of the same problems that they do. Everybody deals with things like romantic difficulties in relationships and death and cancer and abuse.",Jason Isbell,Romantic
"I did send a girl a plane ticket asking her for a visit, I guess that's quite romantic.",Orlando Bloom,Romantic
"The violent quarrel between the abstractionists and the surrealists seems to me quite unnecessary.

"I would pretend to be the French lieutenant's woman. I was always a romantic. I still am, actually.",Helena Bonham Carter,Romantic

"It's so often that I read for the bouncy, sunny girl men fall in love with who will solve all the romantic problems in the narrative. I don't choose to work that way.",Sarah Gadon,Romantic
"Normally, things are viewed in these little segmented boxes. There's classical, and then there's jazz; romantic, and then there's baroque. I find that very dissatisfying. I was trying to find the thread that connects one type of music - one type of musician - to another, and to follow that thread in some kind of natural, evolutionary way.",Jerry Lee Lewis,Romantic
I happen to be really a romantic.,Amanda Seyfried,Romantic
"I broke my nose in gym when a ball hit me. I took a girl to her debutante ball the next week wearing a tux and a big, honking bandage. Not the romantic night she had in mind.",Wentworth Miller,Romantic

"In the end, punk inevitably burned itself out and acted as a bridge across which the New Romantics could sashay in their chiffon and glossy hair.",Jo Brand,Romantic
"I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You're texting. You're wondering what's going on. There's no definitions, there's no labels.",Elizabeth Meriwether,Romantic
"I can't wait for everyone to read 'Don't Look Back.' It's something very different for me, my first romantic suspense novel, so I'm very excited to be sharing the book, finally.",Jennifer Armentrout,Romantic

"I just - I like the saccharin and the gooeyness of 'Bachelor,' and how just gross and like falsely romantic it is. Whereas, like, the 'Real Housewives' is just raw, and it's just - it's the fights that get me. It's just very uncomfortable for me.",Ken Marino,Romantic
"It is possible for a woman to be a romantic, but also to be single and to be happy.",Taylor Swift,Romantic
"Some have called we rock and roll performers who never retire 'troubadours.' I enjoy this misnomer immensely.

"Basically, I'm a romantic.",Pia Zadora,Romantic

"I've seen plays that are, objectively, total messes that move me in ways that their tidier brethren do not. That's the romantic mystery of great theater. Translating this ineffability into printable prose is a challenge that can never be fully met.",Ben Brantley,Romantic
I'd like to be played as a child by Natalie Wood. I'd have some romantic scenes as Audrey Hepburn and have gritty black-and-white scenes as Patricia Neal.,Gloria Steinem,Romantic
"I had a romantic, 'Aren't I a good girl?' take on divorce, but the truth is that was stupid.",Ali MacGraw,Romantic

I don't get a lot of romantic comedy scripts.,Ryan Reynolds,Romantic
I am deeply romantic and a genuine yet complex person.,Jiah Khan,Romantic

"Anders Thomas Jensen and I had talked about making a movie which addressed the cancer issue, and we didn't want to make it heavy-handed. We wanted to do something which had a lot of hope in it. And then for some reason we came up with a romantic comedy.",Susanne Bier,Romantic
My hairline is receding. So my days as a romantic lead - even though I've never had them - are behind me.,John Lithgow,Romantic

I love to have my hair down; I love to have my hair full... there's something romantic about it.,Blake Lively,Romantic

I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be a reporter. I don't know where I got the idea that it was a romantic calling.,Charles Kuralt,Romantic

"I am very romantic. In fact, I just renewed my vows... although it was with another woman.",Kevin Nealon,Romantic

I will never create a romantic angle to survive on a game show.,Karishma Tanna,Romantic

I love romantic comedies. I have a deep respect for them. I think they're really difficult to write and write well.,Rashida Jones,Romantic
"I did something that no brown-skinned man in the movie industry ever did. I made a brown-skinned man look very romantic - a matinee idol.

"My new movie, Fools Rush In, is a romantic comedy and the girl I play in that is very warm, very sweet.",Salma Hayek,Romantic

"It's a very romantic sentiment, but to think that you would die if you didn't write, well, I would definitely choose to not write and live.",Sarah McLachlan,Romantic

"As far as the lack of hits goes, I think perhaps it's because I've played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men, and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.",Jeff Bridges,Romantic
"I'm opening up my heart to the idea of dating. It's funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! I'm really trying hard to spend this time working on myself.",Olivia Wilde,Romantic

I'm sick of playing romantic leads.,John Corbett,Romantic

"If people connect me with the Romantics in general, they probably connect me most with Keats. But Wordsworth is the poet I admire above all others.",Andrew Motion,Romantic
"There's a hardening of the culture. Reality TV has lowered the standards of entertainment. You're left wondering about the legitimacy of relationships. It's probably harder to entertain the same people with a more classic form of writing, and romantic comedies are a classic genre.",Nancy Meyers,Romantic

"What I'd really like to write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie.

"I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies, and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because, in general, they've made me hopeful.

I'm not a romantic. In life I didn't have much experience with romance.,Ang Lee,Romantic
I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.,Taylor Lautner,Romantic
"I would have loved to do 'Alice in Wonderland.' Being a 'Bond' girl would always be fun. We had a lot of action in 'Eclipse' and I'd definitely like to continue down the action road. I want to do a romantic period piece, but those are really hard to get made because they're very expensive and there's not a huge demographic.",Ashley Greene,Romantic
"No, actually 'The Host' was totally a palate-cleanser for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different than romantic love. Romantic love is in there, obviously, because I enjoy writing about that and living it a lot.",Stephenie Meyer,Romantic
I'm not a romantic.,Jack Kevorkian,Romantic
I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends - from a romantic relationship to a friendship.

"I'm a big romantic, so I love guys who are romantic too.",Ashley Tisdale,Romantic
I think the institute of marriage is a noble thing. The idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we're living to 100. A hundred years ago people were dying at age 37. Til death do us part was a much different deal.,Debra Messing,Romantic
"Yeah, romantic comedies are the hardest movies to make. Maybe one works a year.",Dylan McDermott,Romantic

"I'm not about to talk about what's romantic in my life - I figure if you talk about it once, then that's an open invitation for everyone to dig into your personal life even further. So, I just keep my private life to myself.",James Van Der Beek,Romantic
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.",Jerry Saltz,Romantic
There's something about marriage that is not as intensely romantic or interesting as a couple's first meeting.,John Sandford,Romantic
"When you're playing a romantic version of a real person, you're playing a version of the truth.",Andrea Riseborough,Romantic

"Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.",Patti Stanger,Romantic
"I'm a fan of daytime drama; I totally get it. When we are doing scenes that are romantic or will get the audience riled up, I feel like I'm a fan in the room going, 'People are going to be so mad right now!'",Alison Sweeney,Romantic
"Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.",Ginnifer Goodwin,Romantic
"I've always been sort of addicted to genre-jumping. I've never been in the mood to do the same thing I did last time. Hence, me going from 'Big Love' to romantic comedy, to period film... I can't sit still.",Ginnifer Goodwin,Romantic

"I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.",Francine Pascal,Romantic
"I don't want any romantics to go into the military. I'm not a pacifist. I think we need a military, and the better one we have, the better off we are. I don't want kids going in there thinking that it's John Wayne on Iwo Jima. That's not healthy.",Karl Marlantes,Romantic
"So many women today have become so focused on their children, they've developed these romantic entanglements with their children's lives, and the husbands are secondary. They're left out. And the romantic focus is on the children.",Ayelet Waldman,Romantic
"Maybe I'm naively romantic, but I do believe that spice and excitement doesn't stop once a couple gets together.",Stana Katic,Romantic
"If it's a romantic holiday, the only thing I need is my wife. We love quiet and calm places where we can't be disturbed. Neither of us likes being in busy places; we would much rather stay in our hotel room and enjoy each other's company.",Jean Reno,Romantic
I'm a horrible romantic!,Jamie Campbell Bower,Romantic
"Well, there's just some universal truths in a way that I've just observed to be true. You read Voltaire. You read modern literature. Anywhere you go, there's these observations about romantic love and what it does people, and these rotten feelings that rarely are people meaning to do that to each other.",Feist,Romantic
"Romantic music really stirs my soul. And, of course, I love Chinese music; it makes me feel closer to home.",Liu Wen,Romantic
"People say the 'Lost Generation' in a romantic sense, but I think it was tragic. They were really lost.",Corey Stoll,Romantic
"When I was about 14 I remember thinking when it came to proposing to my future girlfriend, I'd make a CD with all her favourite songs and a message that said, 'Will you marry me?' Shows you what a romantic I was. No one listens to CDs any more. It's all about iTunes.",Tinie Tempah,Romantic
"I was the female lead in a romantic comedy. It's a little indie film that we shot in China called 'America Town,' starring Daniel Henney and Bill Paxton. I actually had to speak Chinese in the film. It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai.",Eliza Coupe,Romantic

"I would love to write a mystery - a romantic, funny mystery.",Cecelia Ahern,Romantic

As a successful romantic novelist - one of my publishers is Mills & Boon - I create the sort of male heroes that no woman could fail to adore and few real men could hope to emulate.,P. C. Cast,Romantic
"I hate to sound like a romantic adolescent, but I believe artists don't generally see art as a career choice; they simply can't overcome their desire to make art, and will live on little income for as long as they have to, before they start to sell their work - or give up and get a paying job.",Charles Saatchi,Romantic
"An early editor characterized my books as 'romantic comedy for intelligent adults.' I think people see them as funny but kind. I don't set out to write either funny or kind, but it's a voice they like, quirky like me... And you know, people like happy endings.",Elinor Lipman,Romantic
I'm a bit of a romantic. In theory!,Olga Kurylenko,Romantic
"I think we've always been fascinated with the idea of the romantic outlaw. John Gotti could be in one instance a charismatic, kind and loving family man, and in another, deadly to his enemies. The opportunity to tell the true story of Gotti with John Travolta is a director's dream.",Joe Johnston,Romantic
"When you start off acting, it does seem very romantic, and the make-believe part of it all seems very exciting. It's only later that you begin to realize how fascinating the work is - that it's a bottomless pit, and you never get to the end of it.",Sada Thompson,Romantic
"I don't like the way recording to digital sounds. Most of the time, when I'm recording to two-inch tape, I still have a romantic vision of how songs sounded coming out of the radio when I was younger, and how they sounded coming out of my little four-track cassette player.",M. Ward,Romantic
"I like romantic comedy as a genre, but I think it can get stuck in its ways.",Zooey Deschanel,Romantic
Romantic comedies are usually about when love works.,Zooey Deschanel,Romantic

"My brother has a tendency to get quite lyrical when he writes music; he gets so romantic, it's borderline. I make it slightly more aggressive. I make the round corner a bit sharper.",Josephine de La Baume,Romantic
"I was a very romantic, overly dramatic young lady, which served me well as a songwriter. Especially as someone who had to focus on lyrics and melody, because if you're a dramatic and romantic person, lyrics come easy, and you turn every single short-term relationship into the biggest 'Romeo-and-Juliet' story ever.",Jane Wiedlin,Romantic
"The Germany I was enthused with was more old fashioned and kind of romantic. I just got there, and the next thing you know, I had this huge gilded album. It was kind of an amazing experience because I didn't intend it to be that way.",Rufus Wainwright,Romantic

"When I was pregnant, I had the romantic idea that after the baby was born I would not only take up reading in earnest again, but also write a novel while my daughter slept in her Moses basket.

"I think that romance sort of coincides with effort, so you can fall flat on your face, but as long as you're making a great effort, I think it comes off as romantic. So it can be something as simple as, like, if you're someone who doesn't cook, you can make a meal.",Ashton Kutcher,Romantic

"I think there are certain tenets set in place for all different types on genres. For thrillers, women usually die first. I can't say exactly why, and it's kind of a bummer... But I also can't explain why the wallflower girl in the romantic comedy always gets the guy in the end. That's just the way those movies go.",Katie Aselton,Romantic

"When I started, there was something almost romantic about the notion of paparazzi. I mean, it wasn't. They were still chasing you down the road.

So it was like this age of innocence.",Kylie Minogue,Romantic

"I do feel like guys feel pressure to be funny with me, which is kind of annoying. It's a turn-off if someone's trying hard to be funny because it feels like they're auditioning for a comedy job or something. It doesn't feel romantic to me. I get so much comedy from my life that, from a guy, I'm more looking for something sweet or romantic.",Chelsea Peretti,Romantic
