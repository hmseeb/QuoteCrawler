"Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head. Here is a paradox of fiction-writing.

They come with such a lack of cynicism.",Michelle Forbes,Imagination

Rosenberg,Imagination
"I can get very philosophical and ask the questions Keats was asking as a young guy. What are we here for? What's a soul? What's it all about? What is thinking about, imagination?",Jane Campion,Imagination

"I'd love to play more challenging roles, characters that would stretch my comfort zone and imagination.",Isabelle Fuhrman,Imagination
"I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination.

"I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know.

"But who can paint like Nature? Can imagination boast, amid its gay creation, hues like hers?",James Thomson,Imagination

You are indebted to you imagination for three-fourths of your importance.,David Garrick,Imagination
"The one thing emphasized in any creative writing course is 'write what you know,' and that automatically drives a wooden stake through the heart of imagination.

"With a book called 'Keeping Score,' I really did want to write a book about the Korean War, because I felt that it is the least understood war in the American cultural imagination. So I set out with the idea that Americans didn't know much about the Korean War and that I was going to try to fix a tiny bit of that.",Linda Sue Park,Imagination
"I feel like the Internet needs to be disarmed in some way. There needs to be a philosophical undermining of the Internet. We take it too seriously and too literally.

"Most of my interests in terms of writing are dark, so it's discordant how much I try to lock into the vibe of wherever I'm at. Inhabiting the life of the imagination is the nature of survival strategy - you build yourself little worlds to enjoy.",John Darnielle,Imagination
The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination - what do you dream of wanting to do?,Amanda Lindhout,Imagination
I grew up believing my sister was from the planet Neptune and had been sent down to Earth to kill me. I believed this because my sister Emily convinced me of it when I was a toddler.

"'Super 8' was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun working with J.J. Abrams, who I think is a kid in a grown man's body, which is a great ingredient for any artist in our business. You have to be a kid at heart to be able to make believe, and his imagination is phenomenal.",Glynn Turman,Imagination
"As a bookish child in Calcutta, I used to thrill to the adventures of bad girls whose pursuit of happiness swept them outside the bounds of social decency.

"I'm not a painter by any stretch of the imagination; I'm a dyed-in-the-wool traditional illustrator, and I begin with black and white. If I need colour, I add it over the top. There's a calligraphic element to it... it's about the texture of lines on the page.",Chris Riddell,Imagination
"I am not interested in slice of life, what I want is a slice of the imagination.",Carlos Fuentes,Imagination

"Imagination makes us aware of limitless possibilities. How many of us haven't pondered the concept of infinity or imagined the possibility of time travel?
